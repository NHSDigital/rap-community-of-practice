Introduction What does a working pipeline based on RAP principles actually look like? How is it structured? There\u2019s a lot of great guidance on this site and elsewhere around how to map our your process , create a \"thin slice\" , and write high quality , version controlled code. But a picture (or a codebase) tells a thousand words, and it can be really useful to see good practices put into action in an actual project. While we have a RAP package template that you can use as a base for your own project, this doesn\u2019t show a fully armed and operational pipeline. That\u2019s where the RAP example pipeline comes in! It's a simple pipeline that performs some aggregations on artificial HES data - and you can download and run it yourself in Python or R ! Read on to find out step-by-step how we made this pipeline\u2026 Project Plan In this project, we decided to use the artificial HES data, as it\u2019s freely available and replicates data that's actually in use by the NHS. Our plan was to download one financial year\u2019s data, perform some aggregations, and save the results as new files. Nice and simple. Since we were building this example pipeline from scratch, rather than RAPifying an existing one, there was no existing process we needed to map out. But we did create a map for the new process. flowchart TB %% Input A_ts(Artificial HES data) B_ts(Script to pull down to CSV) B_one(Script to pull down to API) %% Processes C_ts(All of England) C_one(Regional distribution) C_two(ICB distribution) D_ts(Count the number of episodes) D_one(Number of unique individuals) %% Output E_ts(CSV output) E_one(Graph output) %% Generating flowchart subgraph Input A_ts:::thin_slice==>B_ts A_ts-->B_one end subgraph Processes B_ts:::thin_slice==>C_ts B_ts-->C_one B_ts-->C_two C_ts:::thin_slice==>D_ts C_ts-->D_one end subgraph Output D_ts:::thin_slice==>E_ts:::thin_slice D_ts-->E_one end The Thin Slice Once you\u2019ve got a process map in place, we recommend deciding on a \"thin slice\" . This is an end-to-end slice of the pipeline that you can build first, and then expand on \u2013 for example, create one output file, produce one statistic, get the output for one Trust, etc. In this example we opted to count the number of hospital episodes in the HES data file. To do this, we\u2019d have to get several key pieces of the puzzle in place \u2013 getting the data, performing the aggregations, and exporting the results. This makes it a good skeleton to expand upon if we needed to add further analysis in the future. flowchart TB %% Input A_ts(Artificial HES data) B_ts(Script to pull down to CSV) B_one(Script to pull down to API) %% Processes C_ts(All of England) C_one(Regional distribution) C_two(ICB distribution) D_ts(Count the number of episodes) D_one(Number of unique individuals) %% Output E_ts(CSV output) E_one(Graph output) %% Generating flowchart subgraph Input A_ts:::thin_slice==>B_ts A_ts-->B_one end subgraph Processes B_ts:::thin_slice==>C_ts B_ts-->C_one B_ts-->C_two C_ts:::thin_slice==>D_ts C_ts-->D_one end subgraph Output D_ts:::thin_slice==>E_ts:::thin_slice D_ts-->E_one end %% Colour formatting classDef thin_slice fill:#CCFFCC,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px Project Structure We used the RAP template as the base structure for the pipeline which breaks the project into three stages, which are each represented by subfolders of the src folder: data_ingestion processing data_exports You can read more about the project's structure in its readme , and there's more general advice in our project and package structuring guide. The RAP Approach There are a few points in the pipeline where you can see RAP principles in action\u2026 Open Source Tools We used open source tools , namely Python and Spark, to create the pipeline. This means that anyone can download the pipeline, run it, and get the same outputs we did. If we\u2019d used something like SAS, or SSMS, then only people who already have access to these tools would be able to run the process, making it less reproducible. Loose Coupling Loose coupling means two components of a process have a low level of dependence on each other - they are essentially independent. Tight coupling means two components have a high degree of dependence on each other \u2013 which includes things like: one must directly follow the other for the process to work there are highly specific requirements for what the inputs and outputs need to be a change to one component requires a change in the other In RAP we aim for loose coupling \u2013 modular components that can act independently as much as possible. Here\u2019s an example of loose coupling in this pipeline. In src/data_ingestion , we have a function called download_zip_from_url . This function grabs a ZIP file from a specified URL, downloads it, and extracts the contents to a specified location. In src/reading_data , we have a function called load_csv_into_spark_data_frame , This function grabs a CSV from a given file path, and creates a Spark dataframe from it. These two functions are loosely coupled. The first function doesn\u2019t \"care\" what you do with the CSV after it has been downloaded and unzipped. It's a single, independent process that just does its own thing. And the second function doesn\u2019t care where the CSV file came from - it just finds it and reads it. Because these functions loosely coupled, you can more easily lift them out of this project and reuse them elsewhere. By writing your code this way, you develop a library of functions that you can reuse, saving you time creating and testing new functions in the future. It also makes it easier for you to reuse other people\u2019s code. For example, perhaps you have a better function for downloading and extracting a zip file. If so, we could easily plug your function right into this code. Reproducibility through parameterisation Another way we increase reusability in this pipeline is by using parameters in functions. Now, some people will tell you that the ideal number of parameters for a function is zero. There is some truth to this - the fewer parameters functions have, the easier they are to use and understand - generally speaking. However, if you stick too hard and fast to this rule, then your gain in simplicity will come at the cost of reproducibility. For example... In src/processing/aggregate_counts.py we have a function called get_aggregate_counts . It takes a parameter called counting_col , as well as one called alias_name , and returns a new dataframe containing the distinct count of that column, with the specified alias. In the thin slice of this pipeline, we wanted to get the distinct count of the epikey column. So why not just make a function called get_distinct_epikey_count ? See below: That would certainly be a nice, simple function with a clear, single purpose. However, it would be tightly coupled to this process. It requires a dataframe with a column called 'epikey' as its input - otherwise it won't work. That limits reusability - we'd couldn't use this function in other projects unless they need that exact aggregation. Also, what if later in this project we decided we wanted to count ICD codes, or hospital codes, or something else? We\u2019d have to write a whole new function and a test for each one! And then if we wanted to modify this function in some way, we\u2019d have to make that same modification to multiple functions, and perhaps update all their tests, too. That could get time consuming! But by adding this counting_col parameter, we solve all these problems, as it enables us to get the distinct count of any column using just this one function. We can then reuse it more easily within this project and others. You can find more general tips on functions in the Python function guide . Have a go! And now over to you - why not try running the example pipeline and seeing what results you get? The full instructions are in the readme . Once you get it going, look at the process map and try expanding upon the thin slice. (hint: there\u2019s a function in src/processing that hasn\u2019t been used yet, but might be useful\u2026). As you do this, think about if there are any places you could apply the methods described above in your own projects. As of course, maybe you'll see a way the example pipeline might be improved.

Tight coupling means two components have a high degree of dependence on each other \u2013 which includes things like: one must directly follow the other for the process to work there are highly specific requirements for what the inputs and outputs need to be a change to one component requires a change in the other In RAP we aim for loose coupling \u2013 modular components that can act independently as much as possible. Here\u2019s an example of loose coupling in this pipeline. In src/data_ingestion , we have a function called download_zip_from_url . This function grabs a ZIP file from a specified URL, downloads it, and extracts the contents to a specified location. In src/reading_data , we have a function called load_csv_into_spark_data_frame , This function grabs a CSV from a given file path, and creates a Spark dataframe from it. These two functions are loosely coupled. The first function doesn\u2019t \"care\" what you do with the CSV after it has been downloaded and unzipped. It's a single, independent process that just does its own thing. And the second function doesn\u2019t care where the CSV file came from - it just finds it and reads it. Because these functions loosely coupled, you can more easily lift them out of this project and reuse them elsewhere. By writing your code this way, you develop a library of functions that you can reuse, saving you time creating and testing new functions in the future. It also makes it easier for you to reuse other people\u2019s code. For example, perhaps you have a better function for downloading and extracting a zip file. If so, we could easily plug your function right into this code.","title":"Loose Coupling"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/example-pipeline/#reproducibility-through-parameterisation","text":"Another way we increase reusability in this pipeline is by using parameters in functions. Now, some people will tell you that the ideal number of parameters for a function is zero. There is some truth to this - the fewer parameters functions have, the easier they are to use and understand - generally speaking. However, if you stick too hard and fast to this rule, then your gain in simplicity will come at the cost of reproducibility. For example... In src/processing/aggregate_counts.py we have a function called get_aggregate_counts . It takes a parameter called counting_col , as well as one called alias_name , and returns a new dataframe containing the distinct count of that column, with the specified alias. In the thin slice of this pipeline, we wanted to get the distinct count of the epikey column. So why not just make a function called get_distinct_epikey_count ? See below: That would certainly be a nice, simple function with a clear, single purpose. However, it would be tightly coupled to this process. It requires a dataframe with a column called 'epikey' as its input - otherwise it won't work. That limits reusability - we'd couldn't use this function in other projects unless they need that exact aggregation. Also, what if later in this project we decided we wanted to count ICD codes, or hospital codes, or something else? We\u2019d have to write a whole new function and a test for each one! And then if we wanted to modify this function in some way, we\u2019d have to make that same modification to multiple functions, and perhaps update all their tests, too. That could get time consuming! But by adding this counting_col parameter, we solve all these problems, as it enables us to get the distinct count of any column using just this one function. We can then reuse it more easily within this project and others.

Anyone can do this - it's the first thing you should do when starting some RAP work Before we dive in, here is a fun example of a process map from XKCD : RAP deals with improving processes, but before doing any programming, it really helps to understand what we already have; a great process map really helps with this! Be the envy of your peers, and the talk of the time, by making a visual journey through your process, and you might even come across some quick win improvements on the way! How to map a process There is a nice guide to process mapping here , however in brief: Write down your process (or if you've got a process document already, lucky you!) Split this into steps. it can be helpful not to go too granular initially; keep it high level - we don't need \"click this button, then this button, etc.\" instead, write what is intended, not how it is implemented, e.g. step 1: load the data into the database Use flowchart symbols (or some other way if you prefer) to describe what each step is You can then take this further by analysing the process map and identifying repeated or manual steps - RAP can help with this! Example (using Markdown and Mermaid) Let's imagine we had a simple process: Analysts get given a CSV, which they load into a SQL server, enter today's date, after which they run the SQL script and take the output into Excel. Splitting this into the steps: Take two CSVs and load them each into the database manually. Manually type in today's date, then run a SQL script that produces some analytical output in a table. Manually extract this into an Excel spreadsheet. We can then transform this into a flow chart: (this uses Mermaid ) graph LR A[Manually Load CSV 1]:::manual --> B[(Database)]; C[Manually Load CSV 2]:::manual --> B; H[/CSV 1/] --> A I[/CSV 2/] --> C D[Manually type in today's date]:::manual --> E[[Run SQL Script]] B --> E E --> F[Manually extract results into Excel]:::manual F --> G[/Excel Output/] classDef manual fill:#FFCCCC Using a process map to find improvements Because a flowchart lays out the process clearly, it can make it easier to find things to improve, such as: - redunant steps or similar tasks being done several times - manual steps - pull out complex tasks into \"sub tasks\" -> which might also need flow charts! - this can also help you structure your code and decide when to break the code into different files Following on from our example above: - we can see a few manual steps - could these be automated? - There are two tasks which \"load CSVs\" - could we make one automated process which can be run twice to load both? Or even just one task which loads both? Considering this, we could imagine an improved process diagram, which might then form the basis of our RAP work: graph LR A[Load CSV] --> B[(Database)]; H[/CSV 1/] --> A I[/CSV 2/] --> A D[Calculate todays date] --> E[[Run SQL Script]] K[Get todays date manual/config]:::manual --> E J{Is todays date provided?} -->|no| D J -->|yes| K B --> E E --> F[Generate Excel output] F --> G[/Excel Output/] classDef manual fill:#FFCCCC We can see above that we made a new \"load CSV\" task and that we changed many manual tasks to sound more automated \"Generate\" rather than make. Note perhaps you could use Python to automate the manual tasks? We also added a bit of logic, where the process will calculate today's date if it is not given it - so we haven't removed every manual step (someone might still need to \"give\" the correct date to the process) - but we've managed to minimise the manual steps .

In the medium and long-term, using RAP's is hugely time-saving, since you will have automated so much of your workflow. But in the short term, setting up that automation is demanding. We advise that you make space for training, building, and managing your RAP project. Time to engage with the training resources As a very rough ballpark estimate, expect someone with no coding experience to take ~15 hours to complete the training listed in the skills section; and a further ~8 hours to complete the training we provide e.g. Python , Git , R . Time to create the RAP Designing, coding, and testing your new pipeline is a time consuming process; especially if this is your first RAP project. We recommend making sure that a group of people are working together on this. Time commitments will, of course, depend upon the nature of the project. Time to continue with business as usual Many teams which engage in building a RAP are doing so in order to replace something which already exists, such as a publication pipeline. It is crucial that you plan for enough resource to continue deploying the current version of your product whilst the RAP is being developed. Time for management to provide support Your team management may or many not be involved in writing the code for your new RAP. Either way, there will still be significant work for them in managing surrounding issues. One example: a project we worked on had significant issues with the data being supplied; problems which were only revealed by the work of the RAP project. Addressing these issues was not part of the pipeline per se, but the team manager had to devote significant time to fixing the issue nonetheless. Staff availability Do your team members have annual leave coming up? If so, will this create any bottle necks, i.e. for code reviewing? Pressures on team Do you have any deadlines coming up?

Stage 1: mapping out the current pipeline, identifying the smallest output and working to replicate it using open source methods. Stage 2: From that, the re-useable components are identified and the thin-slice is scaled out to cover the entire output. Benefits: This process allows your team to identify pipeline issues early in the project while progressing quickly on the project, obtaining small wins while building up comprehensive understanding of the pipeline The RAP team at NHS England often adopts a 'thin-slice' strategy for migrating legacy pipelines. Inspired by DevOps practices in software development, the 'thin-slice' strategy involves building the smallest functional component end-to-end rather than tackling the whole project at once. By building something end-to-end you get a lot of benefits such as: Quick Progress Demonstration: The approach allows for quick demonstration of progress, boosting morale and convincing leaders to support the ongoing project. Early Issue Identification: Building the end-to-end process helps identify major problems at the project's outset, such as database issues or the firewall blocking access, enabling timely solutions and preventing last-minute surprises. Comprehensive Problem Understanding: When working through the project in a linear sequence, you may not understand how all parts fit together until the very end, leading to poor pipeline design. Building end-to-end, you can identify re-usable parts, make radical improvements and iterations at very lost cost. This strategy is particularly relevant for the work we are trying to do here. We are trying to achieve a number of competing goals and the thin-slice helps us to mediate between them. For example: Goal Solution Consequence We want to build this pipeline as quickly as possible Accept the most basic code that is functional despite lower code quality Code will be more difficult to run and maintain. Risk that tech debt may snowball until BAU delivery becomes impossible We want to build the best possible pipeline Hire a team of external specialists to do it for us Risk that the team becomes demotivated or does not understand the code We want to train our analysts to write good code Give analysts lots of defended time away from their day job with high-quality in-person training BAU delivery will slow down. May not be possible given resource constraints Depending on which of these you want to prioritise - do it quickly, do it well, or build capacity - you would take an entirely different approach. All three are valid but each entails negative consequences that need to be acknowledged. Thin-slice pipeline In reality, we want some strategy that enables us to mediate between these competing demands to achieve all three outcomes - a high-quality pipeline that is developed quickly and with analysts feeling like they understand and own it. The thin-slice strategy balances these outcomes and fits well with the support model the RAP team offers - where we work alongside a team who understand the data well. The typical workflow looks something like this: Stage 1 Phases Description Map out the processes Visually map out the current process by dissecting the existing code, identifying each step in the pipeline. Here we can pinpoint redundant elements of the process, obtaining quick wins when it comes to optimising our pipeline. Have a look at our Process Mapping page for some guidance on how to achieve this. Identify the minimal outputs Identify the minimal outputs that we will be replicating for the thin-slice. For example, we will reproduce the national numerator and denominator for one measure. Replicate the target minimal output Replicate those outputs as quickly as possible, focusing more on obtaining the numerical output than writing the most optimal code, getting to grips with the logic of the process. Since we are only dealing with a small subset of the overall publication, we avoid getting overwhelmed with the nuances of the pipeline. This phase forces us to grapple with a lot of the complexities of the process - e.g., funny joins, complex derivations, or logic that is spread across multiple sections of code. By grappling with the tough parts early, we pave the way for a more efficient and robust development process. Tip While replicating the minimal output we have regular talks with stakeholders to check this is following their needs and providing what is necessary. Stage 2 Phases Description Identify the re-useable components and improve the thin-slice Once the target output has been achieved, we can turn our focus to improving how this is done. We do this with the principles described in our Refactoring Guide . As this is just a sliver of the overall project it does not take long, but provides an excellent baseline from which to build the rest of the project. It is essential that this is done collaboratively between members of the RAP team and the publication team. The publication team bring an expert understanding of why the process works a certain way, while the RAP team bring experience of having worked with similar processes across multiple projects. Because the publication team are actively contributing to the decisions, they end up with a feeling of ownership over the code and an understanding of how it works. Scale out the thin slice We now start tackling the rest of the outputs by expanding the thin-slice. This would be done strategically, perhaps tackling a breakdown first, then a complex derived field and then a field which requires joining some reference data. The remaining fields and breakdowns are added to the backlog, and analysts pick up these tickets in turn. Tickets are considered done when the new field gives the same value as the historic output and the code has been peer-reviewed by another analyst. This phase tends to go remarkably quickly. This is because we already tackled all the hard bits up front and everyone is working from the high quality thin-slice template that they helped to build. FAQs What is the difference between a 'thin-slice' and a minimal viable product (MVP)? The thin-slice denotes the essential functionality required to construct a complete end-to-end pipeline. This initial development phase serves as a valuable training opportunity for the team and contributes to enhancing the overall code quality. It is driven by the goal of enabling the delivery team to work efficiently and is not intended as a deliverable for customers. By contrast, an MVP is the most basic thing that a team could deliver to customers. MVP has a really peculiar meaning in the context of a pipeline migration since the 'minimal' thing to be delivered will typically be the full publication. What happens if rebuilding the pipeline uncovers errors in the existing pipeline (and hence published statistics)? It is a near certainty that some minor errors will be discovered as part of any migration. This is particularly the case for building RAP pipelines since you are adding additional tests and safeguards to spot errors. We consider this a natural and important opportunity to improve the publication. We sit down with the team and discuss where the issue may have arisen and how we can prevent it in the future. Likewise, if there is an opportunity to make a substantial improvement to an existing publication we address that in collaboration with the team. We do not hold too tight to the idea of replicating historical outputs but instead aim for a pragmatic approach. What happens if we discover more problems after we have moved out of the thin-slice phase? You will almost certainly discover more problems after the thin-slice phase. However, the high code quality that comes from the thin-slice phase and the team understanding of how the code works will make it easier to resolve the problem, e.g., by refactoring the code. How would this strategy work in a situation where you were working on a brand new project, rather than migrating a legacy pipeline? The same logic would apply. By identifying a very small piece of functionality and trying to implement it end-to-end, you will get a better sense of the problem and how to fix it.","title":"Thin slice strategy"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/thin-slice-strategy/#thin-slice-pipeline","text":"In reality, we want some strategy that enables us to mediate between these competing demands to achieve all three outcomes - a high-quality pipeline that is developed quickly and with analysts feeling like they understand and own it.

Why publish your code? The Government's Digital Service Standard 12th principle states that all publicly funded code should be open, reusable and available under appropriate licences. The main benefits of publishing your code are: It increases transparency on NHS work. This can include publication/dashboard methodologies, but also code ownership. It increases collaboration and knowledge sharing across cross-department teams, external users and developers. No time is wasted on requesting permissions or access to code repositories. Easier to share and align on standards across the health sector. Knowing that your code will be published will lead to your overall code health increasing as analysts and developers will take greater care in ensuring best coding practices and standards are applied. Reduce burden by sharing and reusing code. Internal and external users can learn from your code repositories and templates, and apply it to their work or personal projects. The Government Digital Service released an informative video on the benefits of coding in the open, from the start of a project. How to prepare your code and repository We have designed a process which will ensure no sensitive data or algorithms will be published, removing any risks associated with any type of sensitive information being released. Projects and publications with the aim to be published should follow the Fit-for-publishing workflow : Workflow initial steps Starting point: After designing and developing the source code (e.g. on NHS Digital's internal Gitlab instance), you should ensure at this step that your repository, code and tests are all set and ready for external review, having addressed any security concerns. Your project is ready to go through Senior Manager approval for publishing and enter the Publishing Assurance phase, once approval is granted. Expect that all code should be published unless there's an evidence based case to not publish . At the beginning of this phase a snapshot of the project's repository is taken (download the zip file of the branch) or a separate GitLab branch is created for the review. The purpose of the snapshot is to remove all repository history and previous commits. After creating the snapshot, the next step is to apply the Fit-for-publishing checklist : Fit for publishing checklist This checklist covers the review process in place to ensure that the code is: Fit for purpose Well documented No credentials or personally identifiable information left in the repository No data should be stored in the snapshot. To access the checklist click on the link below and select the Download option: PDF version for viewing: Fit for publishing checklist PDF Download the Work doc version to edit: Fit for publishing checklist Word For each subsection of the checklist: an internal reviewer (someone who worked on the project) is assigned by the development team to check and add comments and suggestions to be implemented. Once those are reviewed and implemented the checklist is passed on to an external reviewer (outside of the development team) to carry out checks and add any comments and suggestions in the external review columns. Once the external review is complete, each checklist section is assigned a RAG status by the project's lead analyst ( Confirmation of Readiness by Lead Analyst step in the workflow diagram above ). Once the repository is granted the final confirmation for publishing from a Senior Manager (as per the workflow diagram shown above), you can then proceed to the final step, which is going live with your Github repository on the NHS Digital public repository . Please note: Should the workflow at any point reach to a failed step, follow the workflow diagram towards the revision and iteration steps. Moving your code to the NHS Digital GitHub To publish the code on Github, you need to make a repo and then just upload your repo snapshot (see above). You'll need to be, or become a member of the NHS Digital Github organisation to do this. For NHS England colleagues, we've made a guide with specifically how you do each of the above . Adding topics to your GitHub repository Adding topics to your repository can be useful for users who are searching on GitHub to find similar topics of interest, e.g. an user searching for RAP repositories using rap or a user searching for NHS repositories containing analytical work with the topic nhs-digital-publication . GitHub has very good documentation on how to add topics to your repository, see here .

Being able to find, adapt, and use code you find online is just a part of the job these days. In fact - unlike other industries - in the coding world, we want other people to use our work. We love sharing code! This makes for a great support community of programmers online. And of course it's a key principle of RAP . However, even when open-sourcing their code, developers sometimes put some restrictions on what people can do with it. For example, they might state that you can only use their code in other open-source projects. Or they might require people to document any changes made to the code. So, if you find some open-source code, how do you know what those restrictions are, if any? How can you tell people what your restrictions are? That's where open source software licences come in. What is a software licence? A software licence is a little bit of legal text telling people what they can and can't do with the code. There are many different licences, each with their own nuances. There's a nice desciption of them on the Choose a Licence website. Which licence should I use? We recommend the MIT Licence. It's a simple and permissive licence, stating people can use the code for anything, as long as the MIT licence is also included whenever the code is reused. It's a Licence to Share! This type of permissive licence is recommended in the Goldacre Review : \"In our strong view all code whose production is paid for by public funds should be shared as open source code for review, re-use, and iterative improvement under open licenses, such as the MIT Open License; but with a robust and publicly documented exceptions framework using clear prespecified criteria whereby researchers or vendors can request special treatment, where this can be shown to be in the national interest, or provide some other comparable benefit.\" So essentially, use MIT unless there's a justifiable reason not to - for example, your code if subject to regulatory requirements. For more information, see the NHSX guidance on licences . How do I apply a licence to my code? If you're using GitHub: Follow these steps: Add a license to a repo If not using GitHub (or want to create a licence manually): Create a file in the root directory of your repo called \"LICENCE\" (without a file extension is common, you'll also see \"LICENCE.txt\" sometimes). Then paste the text of the licence into that file, which in the case of the MIT licence is: Copyright <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \u201cSoftware\u201d), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Being able to find, adapt, and use code you find online is just a part of the job these days. In fact - unlike other industries - in the coding world, we want other people to use our work. We love sharing code! This makes for a great support community of programmers online. And of course it's a key principle of RAP . However, even when open-sourcing their code, developers sometimes put some restrictions on what people can do with it. For example, they might state that you can only use their code in other open-source projects. Or they might require people to document any changes made to the code. So, if you find some open-source code, how do you know what those restrictions are, if any? How can you tell people what your restrictions are?

It's a simple and permissive licence, stating people can use the code for anything, as long as the MIT licence is also included whenever the code is reused. It's a Licence to Share! This type of permissive licence is recommended in the Goldacre Review : \"In our strong view all code whose production is paid for by public funds should be shared as open source code for review, re-use, and iterative improvement under open licenses, such as the MIT Open License; but with a robust and publicly documented exceptions framework using clear prespecified criteria whereby researchers or vendors can request special treatment, where this can be shown to be in the national interest, or provide some other comparable benefit.\" So essentially, use MIT unless there's a justifiable reason not to - for example, your code if subject to regulatory requirements.

Versioning and Changelogs When you update your code, you've done the pull request, and it's all ready to be moved over to the public repo, it's a good time to tag the repo with a semantic version (in GitHub this can be done using the \"release\" functionality). You could also maintain a CHANGELOG.md so users can easily see what has changed since your last version release. If you do a release with a version in the private repo, make sure you also release with the same version tag on the public repo . How often to update the published code? Main Points ultimately it's up to the person who \"owns\" the codebase and the needs of the stakeholders small changes can probably be batched up and then the published code updated less frequently Each codebase (for a publication, package or whatever) will be different and will need changing at different rates, decided by the needs of the stakeholders, available resources and the person in charge of that codebase.

Code review is one of the most important practices that a team can adopt. The benefits include: Ensuring the overall code health of the codebase is improving over time. Sharing knowledge and building skill across the team. Reducing turnover risk by gradually making the team familiar with all aspects of the code. Reduce the likelihood of breaking the code by making sure a second pair of eyes has checked. Questions to ask during code review Does the code work as expected? Does the work actually meet the acceptance criteria in the user story? Is the code well structured or would it benefit from redesign/refactoring? Could the code be made simpler? Is this level of complexity justified? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future? Does the code include appropriate tests? Does the code follow our style guides? These questions are not intended to be comprehensive but rather to give you a starting point for the discussion.

Hopefully this guide will still prove useful as: You can refer back to it in future projects when you have more flexibility You can use the information to support requests for more / improved options when it comes to tooling Why should I care? A core component of the development process of a reproducible analytical pipeline is the tool used to actually develop the code. The appropriate tool(s) will support the work being done - e.g. by spotting syntax errors or potential bugs - while inappropriate tools may prove a hindrance - e.g. autocompletion designed for a different language to the one being written. The choice of development tools can have consequences for many aspects of the project including, but not limited to: Implementation of deliverables : are you producing a software package or a piece of analysis? Who is the target audience? How will they interact with the outputs? QA / review & testing processes : how will your outputs be reviewed / checked? Will your code need to be updated and reviewed again later? Will everything be supervised by a human or do you need automated checks? Reproducibility : how will someone else reproduce your work? Are there any risks based on the tools you've used? E.g. think of notebook cells run out of order Delivery speed & timescales : do you need to quickly produce some charts / statistics? Will your project benefit from a longer time to set up over the lifespan? Ultimately, while there is not necessarily a 'right' or 'wrong' choice, it is worth taking the time to consider the options and pick the most appropriate tool for the job. Notebooks vs. IDEs The table below gives a summary of the features of notebooks compared to IDEs. For more details on each point see the detailed breakdown in the following sections. Feature Notebooks IDEs Interactive outputs (tables, plots, etc) O X* Storytelling and sharing results O X Benefits out-of-the-box (minimal configuration) O X Deterministic outputs (i.e. same result every run) X O Supports modular code structure & packages X O Supports unit testing frameworks X O Nice version control (e.g. readable git diffs) X O Autocomplete / auto-formatting & syntax highlighting X O Compatible with sharing code external to NHS England X O Key X: Unavailable / hard to configure O: Built-in / easy to set up *See Interactive cells in IDEs? Benefits of notebooks Notebooks are a great tool for data exploration and quick ad hoc discovery. However they are not great for collaborative projects, and sharing notebooks can lead to accidental PII disclosure . Since notebooks are bundled with outputs from the most recent run, you will need to be extremely careful about accidental PII disclosure if you are sharing notebooks. Interactive outputs The primary feature of notebooks of any flavour is the interactivity. Code in notebooks is written in snippets within sections called 'cells' where each cell has its own output; often interactive in some way - e.g. tables where the user can scroll through and select rows and columns, plots which can be zoomed or panned, and so on. This is useful for the exploration, analysis and prototyping phases of a project , where the aim is to understand a dataset, either by creating visualisations or by digging deeper into some of the row-level data. Interactivity ith scripts/modules/etc in an IDE isn't always possible or especially easy, which makes notebooks a good choice for ad hoc analytical work, especially earlier on in the project timeline. Markdown cells Notebook cells can contain different types of content: Python, R and SQL but also Markdown which allows you to format text. This means you can add additional non-code content to notebooks, for example adding headings, bullet points, inserting images, and many other things. Cells containing code can be hidden to reveal only their outputs so that you can create a fully interactive, code-free presentation of analysis- great for presenting findings to stakeholders. Notebooks can be exported as HTML files and the full analysis shared online (i.e. embedded in a webpage) or offline (i.e. as a static file). This saves you from having to create a separate report, and manually copying outputs over, and outputs automatically updating if changes are made to the code. Quick to get up and running Notebooks are generally set up to work out of the box, enabling the users to connect to the data and get started working right away. IDEs on the other hand either come in two flavours: big, feature-heavy ones take a lot of set up and plugins to get going; lightweight ones like Atom or Visual Studio Code are often little more than text editors out-of-the-box. While IDEs offer almost limitless customisability (you can even write your own themes and extensions for a lot of them!) and powerful, development-enhancing functionality, they often take more time to get set up in the first place. IDEs require you to have an adequate environment for them to be installed, used and customised (i.e. installing useful extensions). This can be prohibitive, for instance at NHS England where installing software to local machines is restricted. Benefits of IDEs The best IDEs incorporate some of the benefits of notebooks, while also allowing better version control, and easier development of reproducible code. Deterministic code For data pipelines which are intended to be rerun multiple times, potentially by different systems/users, scripts in an IDE adhere to the RAP principles more readily than notebooks . In a notebook, it is possible for two analysts to generate different results from the same notebooks, based on the order in which cells are executed. In long notebooks it can be hard to spot this happening or where it originated. Writing a script within an IDE makes it difficult for this to occur as the same set of logical steps will be executed in the same order every time the script runs. Modularisation In an IDE it's easy to write reusable pieces of code and separate these out into clearly named files and folders that can be imported into the main pipeline. For larger projects, writing code in a modular structure within an IDE improves code quality, readability and maintainability compared to having extensive notebooks. This is more challenging with notebooks, because importing functionality from notebooks can be complicated: Importing code in Jupyter notebooks Jupyter notebooks require quite a bit of arduous coding gymnastics to perform what in Python files would be simple imports ( importing Jupyter notebooks ) Importing code in Databricks notebooks Databricks provides a magic %run command, which is essentially equivalent of inserting all the cells from the notebook being run into the current notebook ( %run command in Databricks ) When %run is called, the two notebooks share the same scope ; this means that any objects (variables, functions etc.) available for reading and writing in the cells of one notebook are available for reading and writing in the cells of the other. The parent (left) errors because the child (right) causes hidden changes within the scope After the %run there can be references to objects that are hidden in the child notebook. This can make code harder to understand, introduce unintended side effects and lead to bugs . Unit testing Please see the unit tests guide for more information about unit testing. It is much easier to implement unit tests with scripts in an IDE than in notebooks. This is partly due to the modular structure : code can be broken down into functions and classes contained within small, manageable files and subdirectories; each test then only interacts with the relevant part of the code which makes debugging easier. Testing frameworks, such as unittest and pytest, do not properly support notebooks. While testing is possible in a notebook workflow, it is hard to isolate code in each cell and thus to trace back errors. Version control Notebooks are inherently difficult to review and audit through version control software like Git . They are stored in a JSON format, which is rendered nicely on screen for the user when viewed through the tool (e.g. Jupyter / Databricks), but which makes it hard to see differences between versions. Git diff from a (simple!) Jupyter notebook: lots to look at! Files in IDEs are generally simpler to version control. It is easy to compare a line in a file between two given versions since everything is designed to be read by humans. This makes it easy to understand what has changed between each version of a file and to rollback to previous versions if required. Git diff from a Python file: much clearer! Package building Python packages are essentially a collection of files bundled together containing the code and its dependencies. To build a Python package that other developers can install, use of other packages like setuptools or poetry is required. Unfortunately, these tools offer poor support for notebooks, so if one of the deliverables for a project you're working on is the code packaged up in a way that others can reuse and implement in their projects, then an IDE workflow is realistically the only way to achieve this. Additional features Notebooks are focused on analytical work, but IDEs are designed for software development: they offer features to support the person writing the code, such as auto-completion & formatting as well as syntax highlighting and linting. These features can make writing code in IDEs faster and easier with the result that code is easier to read and of higher quality . While some such features exist in notebooks, such as auto-closure of brackets and quotations, the scope of the functionality is quite limited. Interactive cells in IDEs Some IDEs offer ways to use Jupyter-like cells within scripts/modules: special comments in the code (e.g. VSCode and Spyder use # %% ) are used to mark different 'cells'; the IDE or some extensions (e.g. the Python extension in VSCode) will identify these comments and allow code within a cell to be run 'interactively'; results from running interactive cells are stored in an IPython kernel that the IDE is running, but no outputs are saved within the code or the metadata as they with Jupyter notebooks. Using interactive cells in IDEs can offer a nice balance for analysts implementing RAP in their working practices. This comes with all the benefits of an IDE workflow , without risking accidental PII disclosure.

Where do I go from here? Hopefully, it is clear that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' choice when it comes to workflow: rather it is a question of which workflow is going to better support the needs of the project. We have created a suggested workflow that is not intended to be seen as the recommended or best approach, but offers a good starting point for analysts & data scientists looking to get started setting up a workflow. img[src*=\"#bigimg\"] { width:100%; } img[src*=\"#smallimg\"]{ width:45%; }","title":"Notebooks vs IDE development"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/workflow/notebooks_versus_ide_development/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"implementing_RAP/workflow/notebooks_versus_ide_development/#what-is-this-guide-for","text":"This guide compares common tools used by data analysts/scientists when developing code: iPython notebooks, such as Jupyter or Databricks - this guide will focus primarily on the latter Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Spyder Specifically this guide compares writing notebooks in browser-based environments (such as Jupyter or Databricks) with writing text-based files (e.g. Python files with a .py extension) in IDEs.

It sets out the best practice in quality assurance, drawn from engagement with organisations across the UK public and private sectors. The book lists several assurance activities to provide confidence to the model developers, assurers and users that a given version of the model is fit for purpose (with 'purpose' defined in the model scope documentation). One way to assess the level of confidence in the model is through the below checklist. It helps to identify omissions or areas for improvement so that analysts and decision-makers can judge the risks of using outputs from the model as it stands. You can also create the QA log to audit if the QA plan has been followed \u2013 tracking who did the work, who reviewed, etc. This should be completed during model development by the developer and post-development by those performing QA work. The QA checklist and log should be sent alongside any analysis that goes for clearance to assess the risk associated with any evidence generated by the model. Quality assurance checklist Here is a quality assurance checklist which we adapted from ONS's Quality Assurance of Code for Analysis and Research and updated to apply in Data Science team for some previous projects. You can select the relevant steps for your project depending on its complexity and the required level of quality assurance. Governance and IG Do we have an approved commission? Do we have IG approval to access the data? Do we have agreed scope and requirements? Do we have a clear and comprehensive project specification? Do we know the key stakeholders? Do we have a plausible delivery roadmap? Do we know who will sign off on the project Do we have a QA plan? Do we have a QA log? Project management The roles and responsibilities of team members are clearly defined. An issue tracker (e.g Jira or Trello) is used to record development tasks. New issues or tasks are guided by users\u2019 needs and stories. Issues templates are used to ensure proper logging of the title, description, labels and comments. Acceptance criteria are noted for issues and tasks in JIRA board. Decision log, explaining why we made various choices Quality assurance standards and processes for the project are defined. Data management Do we have agreed data specifications for all inputs? Do data owners agree that the data is fit for purpose? Do we validate all input data? Do we check for extreme and marginal values? Input data are stored safely and are treated as read-only. Input data are versioned. All changes to the data result in new versions being created, or changes are recorded as new records Input data is documented in a data register if possible, including where they come from and their importance to the analysis. Input data has been profiled and checked with the users' expectations Outputs from your analysis are disposable and are regularly deleted and regenerated while analysis develops. Your analysis code can reproduce them at any time. Non-sensitive data are made available to users. If data are sensitive, dummy data is made available so that the code can be run by others. Data quality is monitored, as per the government data quality framework . Fields within input and output datasets are documented in a data dictionary. Large or complex data are stored in a database. Project structure and clarity Do we have a process flow diagram? (data flow, diagram, etc. as appropriate) Do we have a README.md in the package that explains how it works and where to start? (This file details the project purpose, basic installation instructions, and examples of usage). A clear, standard directory structure is used to separate input data, outputs, code and documentation. Where appropriate, guidance for prospective contributors is available including a code of conduct. If the code's users are not familiar with the code, more instructions should be provided to guide lead users through example use cases. Good coding practices Do we have agreed coding standards? Names used in the code are informative and concise. Names used in the code are explicit, rather than implicit. Code logic is clear and avoids unnecessary complexity. Code follows a standard style, e.g. PEP8 for Python and Google or tidyverse for R. Version control Code is version controlled using Git . Code is committed regularly, preferably when a discrete unit of work has been completed. An appropriate branching strategy is defined and used throughout development. Code is open-sourced. Any sensitive data are omitted or replaced with dummy data. Committing standards are followed such as appropriate commit summary and message supplied. Commits are tagged at significant stages. This is used to indicate the state of code for specific releases or model versions. Continuous integration is applied through tools such as GitHub Actions , to ensure that each change is integrated into the workflow smoothly. Modular code Individual pieces of logic are written as functions. Classes are used if more appropriate. Code is grouped in themed files (modules) and is packaged for easier use. Main analysis scripts import and run high level functions from the package. Low level functions and classes carry out one specific task. As such, there is only one reason to change each function. Repetition in the code is minimised. For example, by moving reusable code into functions or classes. Objects and functions are open for extension but closed for modification; functionality can be extended without modifying the source code. Subclasses retain the functionality of their parent class while adding new functionality. Parent class objects can be replaced with instances of the subclass and still work as expected. Code documentation Has a static copy of the code been made available on confluence and shared with stakeholders? (the code version used for QA) Comments are used to describe why code is written in a particular way, rather than describing what the code is doing. Comments are kept up to date, so they do not confuse the reader. Code is not commented out to adjust which lines of code run. All functions and classes are documented to describe what they do, what inputs they take and what they return. Python code is documented using docstrings . Human-readable (preferably HTML) documentation is generated automatically from code documentation. Documentation is hosted for easy access. GitHub Pages and Read the Docs provide a free service for hosting documentation publicly. Configuration Credentials and other secrets are not written in code but are configured as environment variables. Configuration is written as code and is clearly separated from code used for analysis. The configuration used to generate particular outputs, releases and publications is recorded. If appropriate, multiple configuration files are used and interchangeable depending on system/local/user. Peer review Code authors should annotate source code before the review Peer review is conducted and recorded near to the code. Merge or pull requests are used to document review, when relevant. Pair programming is used to review code and share knowledge. Establish a process for fixing defects found during review process Users are encouraged to participate in peer review as a team building activity. Testing Core functionality is unit tested as code. See pytest for Python and testthat for R . Code based tests are run regularly. Bug fixes include implementing new unit tests to ensure that the same bug does not reoccur. Informal tests are recorded near to the code. Stakeholder or user acceptance signoffs are recorded near to the code. Tests are automatically run and recorded using continuous integration or git hooks. The whole process is tested from start to finish using one or more realistic end-to-end tests. Test code is clean and readable. Tests make use of fixtures and parametrisation to reduce repetition. Formal user acceptance testing is conducted and recorded. Integration tests ensure that multiple units of code work together as expected. Dependency management Required passwords, secrets and tokens are documented, but are stored outside of version control. Required libraries and packages are documented, including their versions. Working operating system environments are documented. Example configuration files are provided. Where appropriate, code runs independent of operating system (e.g. suitable management of file paths). Dependencies are managed separately for users, developers, and testers. There are as few dependencies as possible. Package dependencies are managed using an environment manager such as conda env , virtualenv for Python or renv for R . Docker containers or virtual machine builds are available for the code execution environment and these are version controlled. Logging Misuse or failure in the code produces informative error messages. Create error exception handling when founding out critical error Code configuration is recorded when the code is run. Pipeline route is recorded if decisions are made in code. Filter out sensitive data before save and share it Project documentation Does the methodology reflect the latest state of the code? Have we explained the agreed uses and scope of the data - internal, analytical? Have we documented and explained all inputs in the databases? Have we included links to relevant external documentation? Have we written all appropriate caveats? The extent of analytical quality assurance conducted on the project is clearly documented. Assumptions in the analysis and their quality are documented next to the code that implements them. These are also made available to users. Copyright and licenses are specified for both documentation and code. Instructions for how to cite the project are given. Releases of the project used for reports, publications, or other outputs are versioned using a standard pattern such as semantic versioning . A summary of changes to functionality are documented in a changelog following releases. The changelog is available to users.

One way to assess the level of confidence in the model is through the below checklist.

You can also create the QA log to audit if the QA plan has been followed \u2013 tracking who did the work, who reviewed, etc. This should be completed during model development by the developer and post-development by those performing QA work.

When you are developing a codebase (perhaps for the first time), especially a RAP codebase, that uses functions stored in different directories , it can be tricky to know how to easily edit code, experiment with different sections of the pipeline, test other people's changes and debug errors. This guide includes sections on: What you will need to get started A typical workflow , including how to develop code Debugging tips If you run into issues with anything in this guide, one of the best places to find answers is by searching for your problem on StackOverflow . What is this guide for? Setting up a technical working environment is a skill that takes time and energy to learn , and so it may be tempting to stick to \"out-of-the-box\" solutions such as the interactive platform on your Python training course, Google Collab, or Jupyter. These are great tools for prototyping, learning and experimenting, but there are many pitfalls to relying solely on \"out-of-the-box\" solutions . At the end of this guide, the reader should feel more comfortable setting up and using their own technical development environment. Your employer/educator may have restricted your ability to change any part of your technical working environment. If this is the case, then hopefully this guide will at least help your understand more about your current setup. What you will need to get started You will need the following, either on your local machine, or on a virtual machine that you will need to connect to . How to set up and connect to a virtual machine is not in the scope of this guide. A working Python installation. We recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution if you are going to use a conda environment . Git This may need to be configured the first time you use it git config --global user.name \"Your Name Here\" git config --global user.email youremail@example.com Code should generally not run on your local machine Your local machine refers to your computer processing power on your laptop itself. Logging into a platform that allows you to access virtual computation, using AWS or similar does not count as a local machine, that is what we call a 'virtual machine'. Using a virtual machine ensures: Confidentiality: many projects at the NHS involve sensitive data and needs to be protected, which means only working with it in a secure computing environment. Computing Power and Scalability: We can use computing resources with more power than a single laptop, and scale them up and down as needed. Collaboration: Working with others in a shared environment can help reproducibility, especially at the start of a project. However, this does not mean that your local machine cannot be used for code development, as long as nothing sensitive is contained in the code. Typical Workflow There is no 'right' or 'wrong' choice when it comes to workflow, and it is important that you feel comfortable with the tools you use to develop your code. It is also important that the workflow supports the needs of the project. However, there are a lot of different setups and when you are new to Python/code, it can be reassuring to follow a suggested workflow, which we have included below. TL;DR : aim to start analytical pieces of work in notebooks. As the codebase / pipeline grows, refactor the code into functions and classes contained within modules alongside a full test suite - this will help ensure that the outputs are reproducible and the code is maintainable, and it will be necessary when it comes to automating pipelines in production Tip If you do use interactive notebooks (i.e. Jupyter notebooks, .ipynb files), make sure *.ipynb is added to your .gitignore file so that all interactive python notebooks are not tracked. Read more about why in this guide . Starting a project Here is a workflow to get you up and running with any new data science project. (Example code either shown or available via the links provided) Log in to virtual network. ( optional, but recommended ) Create a new conda environment for your project and install any packages you know you will need Activate your conda environment Create a new directory (folder) for your project in your preferred location Navigate inside the directory in the terminal , and initialise the Git repository cd your-project-name git init Open the directory in VS Code, or an editor of your choice code . Create a README.md and give your project a title Create a .gitignore . There is a useful VS Code extension for setting up your .gitignore file. Prototype code using interactive cells and/or notebooks Write code in .py files, separating out functions into modules (directories) where appropriate Test functions in interactive console Use linters to make any formatting corrections Export your package requirements & dependencies to an environment.yml file conda env export --from-history --no-builds | grep -v \"prefix\" > environment.yml Git add and commit the files you have created Create a new repo on GitHub or GitLab then follow the instructions to push your code from your project directory to that repo, this will probably look something like: git remote add origin https://www.github.com/yourname/your-repo-name.git git push origin main And now you're ready to go. Working on an existing project When you are working on an existing project, many of the above steps are no longer needed, and you may need to add in a few extras. (Example code either shown or available via the links provided) Log in to virtual network. ( optional, but recommended ) Navigate inside the directory in the terminal cd your-project-name Activate your conda environment Check the current state of the project and make sure you're on the right branch for what you're doing using git status (Make sure your local version of the project is up to date with GitHub using git pull ). Optional as you're likely the only one working on your branch Open the directory in VS Code, or an editor of your choice Prototype code using interactive cells and/or notebooks Write code in .py files, separating out functions into modules (directories) where appropriate Test functions in interactive console Use linters to make any formatting corrections If you've added any new packages, make sure to update your environment.yml file: conda env export --from-history --no-builds | grep -v \"prefix\" > environment.yml Git add and commit the files you have changed Git push the staged changes When you are ready to create a pull/merge request, you will need to check that your working branch is up-to-date with the main branch and deal with any merge conflicts . ( optional, only create a pull request once you are happy with your changes and want them to be reflected in the main branch ) git pull origin main Create a pull/merge request ( optional, see above ) Tips for how to write code Intended as broad advice for people who may not be very confident in Python and are nervous about 'breaking' an existing codebase . You can't really break anything if you've version controlled it properly . You can always revert back to a previous point in the codebase history. Your code doesn't have to be clean while you're developing it . When they are just starting to get to grips with RAP, some people can be nervous about writing code that isn't all contained in functions, or otherwise \"nice and clean\". It is totally ok for your code to start out messy. Ideally you would make commits frequently when your code is a bit nicer, but to test and try out, messy code is completely fine. Get something working, and then refine it . The most important thing is that you get the output that you want. Then you can go back and refine your code. You can figure out where you've repeated code which should indicate that you can make use of, or create new functions. Don't attempt everything all at once . If you have to write a piece of code that produces a calculated output in a particular format for multiple years and regions, start simple! Start with the output, and maybe start with just one year and one region. Then plug in the formatting, and then expand to other years and regions. Debugging It is much easier to debug code to run through it step-by-step on a sample of the data. This is especially true when you are trying to run code made up of different functions coming from different modules. Interactive tools such as interactive cells and notebooks can provide an easy way to do this. Interactive cells have the benefit of being insertable within the code being developed itself, whereas at other times it's helpful to create an entirely new jupyter notebook to put bits of code in and interrogate each output. Another common strategy is to create a blank Python file , such as temp.py , and only include the bits of code that you want to run, perhaps making use of interactive cells without changing the body of code that is version controlled. You can also insert breakpoints , using breakpoint() in your code, to only run code up to a specified point, which helps you to interrogate your variables to figure out why something isn't working. To proceed to the next breakpoint, type continue into the terminal. An alternative to manually inserting breakpoints is built-in debuggers, something that most IDEs offer, including VS Code. However these can debuggers can require a steep learning curve and it can sometimes hinder progress initially to use them. If you do want to use any of these strategies, it's important to make sure that: temp.py is added to your .gitignore file all jupyter notebooks are automatically ignored. You can do this by adding *.ipynb to your .gitignore. This means that all files with the .ipynb extension will not be tracked. any interactive cells you create are not committed into your codebase. This is not as important as the previous two points, and is more best practice than something to avoid at all costs, but it is advisable, especially when working on collaborative projects to not commit anything interactive as you cannot be sure that the cells will operate in the same way on somebody else's machine due to the setup required.

To proceed to the next breakpoint, type continue into the terminal. An alternative to manually inserting breakpoints is built-in debuggers, something that most IDEs offer, including VS Code. However these can debuggers can require a steep learning curve and it can sometimes hinder progress initially to use them. If you do want to use any of these strategies, it's important to make sure that: temp.py is added to your .gitignore file all jupyter notebooks are automatically ignored. You can do this by adding *.ipynb to your .gitignore. This means that all files with the .ipynb extension will not be tracked. any interactive cells you create are not committed into your codebase. This is not as important as the previous two points, and is more best practice than something to avoid at all costs, but it is advisable, especially when working on collaborative projects to not commit anything interactive as you cannot be sure that the cells will operate in the same way on somebody else's machine due to the setup required.","title":"Debugging"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/workflow/technical-workflow/#acknowledgements","text":"Inspiration has been drawn from: Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a Professional Data Science Environment on Windows My Computer Setup for Data Science The Definitive Data Scientist Environment Setup Setup a Data Science Environment on your Computer VS Code documentation","title":"Acknowledgements"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/workflow/tidy-data/","tags":["Tidy data"],"text":"Adopting inconsistent data formats leads to a huge amount of wasted effort and can actually lead to very complex code. By adopting tidy data format for your work you can both improve your service to users and simplify your own production pipeline. Reference for this guide Hadley Wickham's original paper on tidy format (pdf) Tidy data: Why should I care? \"Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way\" - Hadley Wickham Teams spend a huge amount of effort reshaping and organising data to meet different needs. Tidy data is an attempt to align on a consistent shape for data that can meet most analytical use cases. By doing as much intermediate data processing as possible in tidy format, you can often achieve huge improvements in code complexity and difficulty of maintaining code. Note that adopting tidy data for stats production does not mean that your outputs need to be formatted this way. In fact, it is straightforward to get from a consistent tidy format to any unique format you require. A common bad practice in stats production is to combine data production and data formatting in the same steps. Teams will calculate statistics and at the same time organise that data to match an excel table. This is a natural thing to do as you write code with your output table in mind but this approach leads to multiple problems: Code often gets repeated for different tables - increasing the burden of updating the code each year and increasing the likelihood of errors. Code is messy and difficult to maintain. Code should do one thing only - either produce the data or format the data. Once the data has been formatted it becomes less useful for other analysts since it is not machine readable. Before another team can use the data, they need to reformat it. Tidy data offers a consistent format for data analysis purposes that is easy for analysts to produce, easy for humans to interpret, and easy for statistical tools like Python and R to read. Tidy data offers more flexibility for readability and simplicity for data analysis purposes, as opposed to 'messy' or non-tidy data that can be have its own structure and rules. Tidy data involves \"structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.\" Having a consistent way of storing data, like in the tidy format, allows for analysts to easily use the same tools of analysis in a universal way, for example R or Python. Then, time is spent on producing all kinds of published outputs from the tidy structure, other pieces of analysis and data visualisation outputs such as dashboards. An example of how tidy data enables analysts is that keeping this consistent form of storing data allows analysts to apply longitudinal methods to large datasets that hold years worth of data, critical for healthcare analytics and research. What is tidy data See Hadley Wickham's excellent book for a great explanation It can be confusing in a large dataset which data is an observation (e.g. all measurements for a specific patient across all attributes) and which data is a variable (i.e. the values for a specific type of attribute so the treatment type or the results of a treatment). There are several conventions on how a tidy dataset is structured but the most common one follows Codd's 3rd normal form (Codd, 1990): Each variable forms a column Each observation forms a row Each type of observational unit forms a table Example of tidying up your data A 'messy' or non-tidy dataset displaying results to treatments applied to patients: Patient_ID Treatment A Treatment B 1 N/A 3 2 11 5 3 9 12 The same data but in a tidy format: Patient_ID Treatment Measured_Variable 1 a N/A 2 a 11 3 a 9 1 b 3 2 b 5 3 b 12 Notice how on this table: Each measured variable (i.e. Treatment, Measured Variable) has its own column. Each observation/measurement forms a row. The treatment variable observations form a table of their own, ordering the dataset in a way that connects to the next subtable (i.e. Treatment b). How to tidy your data It's easy to imagine tidy data with a small scale dataset however with real world data things can be trickier. Tidy data follow a similar structure but messy data are unique in their own 'messiness'. In the subsection above, an example of a messy dataset was transformed to a tidy format. Messy data will rarely be that simple and obviously structured in several different ways, depending on what the data is measuring. This subsection will cover the most common issues with messy data and how to apply the tidy format for each example: Note: It's perfectly valid and understandable to have your own structured way of presenting data in your published outputs, like in the table below (Occupation and Salaries). You should only format your data like this as a final output step - after producing your data in tidy format. Tidy data focuses not so much on the data formatting perspective but on the data production side, as tidy data enables the analyst to focus on analytical questions and not on data processing. Internal to NHS England How to transform your tidy data into a publication style output example: From tidy to publication output . This video can be found internal to NHS England within the RAP community of practice MS Teams page under: Files > COP video tutorials > From tidy data to publication 1. BAD: Column headers as values, not as names Using values instead of names as a column header is a quite common form of messy data, however it can be useful for specific cases and computations. In the table below, is an example of various occupations and number of people for each occupation and salary: Occupation <\u00a320k \u00a321k-\u00a330k \u00a331k - \u00a340k \u00a341k - \u00a350k \u00a350k + IT 20 30 60 40 20 Teacher 30 40 50 40 35 Doctor 20 40 50 25 40 Software Dev 10 10 25 25 55 Solicitor 25 25 60 30 50 In order to transform the table above into a tidier format, the columns are transformed into rows and into 2 columns/variables, one for income and one for number of people (example showing first rows for IT): Occupation Income Count IT <\u00a320k 20 IT \u00a321k - \u00a330k 30 IT \u00a331k - \u00a340k 60 IT \u00a341k - \u00a350k 40 IT \u00a350k + 20 Teacher ... ... You can see that the data goes from wide to long. 2. BAD: Multiple variables stored in one column Sometimes a dataset can contain columns which are comprised of multiple underlying variables. In the example table below, data shows an imaginary count of patients in hospitals per region, grouped by gender and age, combined in one column. So for example, m1930 stands for male patients aged 19 to 30 years old. Region Year m018 m1930 m3145 m4665 m6680 m81o f018 f1930 West Midlands 2010 2 5 15 20 25 20 4 6 London 2010 5 10 15 20 25 40 5 10 Yorkshire and the Humber 2010 3 9 8 4 20 23 3 9 North West 2010 5 10 15 12 17 15 2 8 To break apart these columns, different approaches of processing can be used, depending on the column header such as breaking apart the string or if there are separators in the column name (e.g. _ or - or ;), capitals or any type of expression. The results of processing is show below, where the combined column of age and gender has broken into 2 separate variables and adding an extra column for the count of patients (first rows of West Midlands region): Region Year Gender Age Cases West Midlands 2000 m 0 - 18 2 West Midlands 2000 m 19 - 30 5 West Midlands 2000 m 31 - 45 15 West Midlands 2000 m 46 - 65 20 West Midlands 2000 m 66 - 80 25 West Midlands 2000 m 81 + 20 West Midlands 2000 f 0 - 18 4 West Midlands 2000 f 19 - 30 6 3. BAD: Variables stored in both rows and columns The next example can be confusing to tidy, as variables are stored in both rows and columns, so Weather station, Year, Month across Day1, Day2 columns and so forth, and tempmax/tempmin (Element column) stored in rows: Weather station Date Month Element Day1 Day2 Day3... LS123 2018 1 tempmax 29 - - LS123 2018 1 tempmin 10 - - LS123 2018 2 tempmax - 28 25 LS123 2018 2 tempmin - 13 13 LS123 2018 3 tempmax 30 - - LS123 2018 3 tempmin 18 - - LS123 2018 4... tempmax - - - To tidy this, a new column Date needs to be extracted from Year, Month and Day to correspond to each day of observation. Then variables minimum and maximum Temperatures for each date will be stored in two different columns: Weather station Date tempmin tempmax LS123 2018-01-01 10 23 LS123 2018-02-02 13 24 LS123 2018-02-03 13 25 LS123 2018-03-01 18 26 LS123 2018-04-24 17 27 LS123 2018-05-12 19 29 This table is in a tidy format, there is one row for one day's observations and two new columns, one for each variable of the column Element. 4. BAD: Multiple types of observations in one table The next example is subset of data from the top Billboard songs for each year. This data is not in a tidy format. Weeks 4 - 75 have been edited out for readability purposes. Here, there are several variables, Artist, Song Title, Duration, Date Entered, Week and Rank. (as both are the same for each week the song spent in the billboard.) Year Artist Song Title Duration Date Entered Week1 Week2 Week3 1966 The Beatles We Can Work It Out 3:00 1966-01-08 5 2 1 1966 The Beatles Paperback Writer 3:30 1966-06-25 6 3 1 1966 The Beach Boys Good Vibrations 3:00 1966-12-10 7 4 2 1966 The Lovin' Spoonful Summer in the City 3:20 1966-08-13 3 2 1 1966 Four Tops Reach Out I'll Be There 3:10 1966-10-15 9 3 2 Transforming this dataset into a tidy version would cause unnecessary duplication of observations (thus cancelling the 1 observation per row norm), in the table below. Imagine if Weeks 4-75 were not removed, so then we would have 72 rows of repeating the same Artist, Song Title and Duration variables. Date Entered has be edited to include the starting week of every week on the billboard: Year Artist Song Title Duration Date Entered Week Rank 1966 The Beach Boys Good Vibrations 3:00 1966-12-10 1 7 1966 The Beach Boys Good Vibrations 3:00 1966-12-17 2 4 1966 The Beach Boys Good Vibrations 3:00 1966-12-24 3 2 1966 The Lovin' Spoonful Summer in the City 3:20 1966-08-13 1 3 1966 The Lovin' Spoonful Summer in the City 3:20 1966-08-20 2 2 1966 The Lovin' Spoonful Summer in the City 3:20 1966-08-27 3 1 In this instance, it is recommended that the tidy dataset is split into two, one for each observational unit, the song title and the rank of the song: Table 1 ID Artist Song Title Duration 1 The Beatles We Can Work It Out 3:00 2 The Beatles Paperback Writer 3:30 3 The Beach Boys Good Vibrations 3:00 4 The Lovin' Spoonful Summer in the City 3:20 5 Four Tops Reach Out I'll Be There 3:10 Table 2 ID Date Entered Rank 3 1966-12-10 7 3 1966-12-17 4 3 1966-12-24 2 4 1966-08-13 3 4 1966-08-20 2 4 1966-08-27 1 This approach is useful for tidy data buts lacks in data processing tools' capabilities, so in that case these tables will have to be merged again. 5. One type of observational unit in multiple tables There are datasets that have multiple tables and variables and observational units that are spread throughout those tables. Or these tables change frequently over time. Or there are different approaches to data types, missing data, data formats for each of those tables. In these cases, it is recommended that each table is 'tidied' up, and then combine each tidy table. To avoid any potential data duplication, adding an extra IDcolumn in each table as well as a column that records the original table/file's name will ensure that each row of data in the merged tidy table is labelled with its source table/file.

Learning how to troubleshoot problems with these tools quickly is an important skill. At the end of this guide, the reader should feel more comfortable choosing & using tools to suit their needs. Note: This guide (and most of this repository) is written primarily for Python development but some parts are generally applicable to other languages. Most of the more specific tips and tricks are examples from VS Code (other IDEs are available!). The terminal A terminal is basically just a way of giving your computer commands via text (see the more detailed description in the intro to Git guide . This is important because you can do lots of things from the terminal: run Python scripts, launch interactive notebooks, etc. You may also see this referred to as the 'shell'- there is a difference but the terms are often used interchangeably. Many computers only have a terminal , so you have to know how to use the terminal if you want to do things on them. For example: if you set up an instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, you'll need to interact with that machine via the terminal. There are many different terminals, but all of them do basically the same thing. Windows comes with a couple of default terminals that you can find using Windows search: CMD and PowerShell. Although these shells have some similarities with the shells that data scientists usually use (such as bash and zsh), CMD and PowerShell are different enough to sometimes cause issues. Many of the commands are different, and many of the programs that we might want to use can't be called through them. You're welcome to use these default shells if you want, but remember that the commands you find on StackOverflow may not always work. Different terminals use slightly different languages, and so you may find that if you're used to the terminal on a Mac, you need different commands when working on a Windows machine. Some terminals allow you to workaround this- such as Git Bash . Git Bash works on Windows, but emulates the most common terminal experience on a Mac or Linux, allowing to use the same commands. VS Code also comes with an integrated terminal which you'll be able to use. Git Version control is an incredibly important software engineering tool that data scientists use. Essentially, version control helps you do these three things: Save \"snapshots\" of your code, so that you can track your changes over time and go back to different versions of code if needed. (For example, if you break something). Develop new parts of your code, while keeping the primary version of your code clean (using \"branches\"). Collaborate with others on developing different parts of the same code. The most popular version control software is called Git, and there's a very useful website called GitHub which is used in conjunction with git to store your code online and collaborate with others. You can think of git as being local (on your computer), and GitHub as being in the cloud. Some workers in the NHS will find themselves working not on GitHub , but on GitLab . These two services are very similar, and for our purposes can be used interchangeably. Generally speaking, you'll want to create a new git \"repository\" (or repo, for short) for each project you work on. A git repo is simply where all of your code for a project lives. For more information on Git, and instructions on how to use it, see the intro to Git guide . Python The best programmers use the right tool for the job, and this tool may not necessarily be Python. The choice for many is between Python and R: we do not include many R resources in this repository as most people in former-NHS Digital use Python but RAPs are perfectly possible in R. If anything, technical setup is slightly more straightforward in R, as RStudio is a fully integrated development environment that can easily be version controlled. Other open-source languages, such as Rust , Go & Julia may also be options to consider. A note on Python versions It's very important to pay attention to the version of Python you are using to develop your code. This is because some versions of Python packages do not work in the same way with older/newer versions. A handy tool for managing multiple versions of Python is pyenv , or pyenv-win for Windows. If you are using Anaconda, you will be able to specify which version of Python you want to use when you create a conda environment . We appreciate that if you are using a centrally managed virtual machine, there will often only be one version of Python available, in which case, not to worry! Conda environment Virtual environments are a way to make sure your code will run correctly for you and others. By always coding inside a virtual environment, you make it more likely that your work will be usable by others. For more information about why it is highly recommended that you use virtual environments for all of your coding, see our virtual environments guide . We recommend using conda (bundled with Anaconda), an open-source package manager, because, in addition to all the standard benefits of package and environment management: It runs on Windows, MacOS and Linux It's fast and easy to use You can specify the Python version you want to use It was created for Python, but you can also use it for R and other languages The README file This will show up on GitHub when we push the code, written in Markdown (hence the .md extension). Markdown is a \"markup language\", which is basically just a way to write plain text that end up getting formatted nicely. It is used on GitHub and GitLab, and can also be used in an interactive Python notebook cell. On the first line of your README.md file, you should write the title. You must put a # (hash) key followed by a space before the title of your project. The number of hashes sets the header level, with one hash being the title. Other headings in your README should be at least two hashes. On the second line, put a short, one-line description of the project. Code Editing Data scientists can have very strong feelings about their preferred IDE or code editor. Your choice can make a huge difference in your ability to perform your role effectively . IDEs and code editors are development environments that programmers use to write code, test it, debug it and then push changes to GitHub or another version control platform. The right IDE or code editor should work well with the programming languages you want to use, make it easy to organise your files, and allows you to share them without difficulty. IDEs and text editors offer many properties and options to customize your development environment. Some prefer full-on IDEs, while others like lightweight text editors. There are a lot of good editors out there and it doesn't really matter which one you go with, as long as you like it and know how to use it. Our preferred editor is VS Code, because: It's easy to install and setup The command palette makes it easy to customise your setup You can sync your settings to GitHub so you never lose them! You can use extensions to make it as powerful as you need it to be (this may be restricted if you are using your work computer). It has very useful functionality right out of the box with all of the features you would expect like an integrated terminal , syntax highlighting & code completion , linting and debugging tools . Jupyter is supported, via interactive cells and native notebook support If you don't have a favourite code editor, we would highly recommend giving VS Code a shot. Installation and setup Installing VS Code is simple: go to the VS Code website, click \"Download\", and install using the instructions. Using the terminal is the easiest way to launch VS Code. Open up a terminal, type the following, and hit Enter . code . By starting VS Code in a folder, that folder becomes your \"workspace\". If you want VS Code to open up in a particular location, add the file path to the instruction: code path/to/directory Command Palette Access the 'Command Palette' (Ctrl+Shift+P) from within VS Code to see a list of possible commands and settings. You can search for something particular by typing what you are looking for in search bar. For example, search for \"lowercase\" to show the command that you could use to lowercase a text selection. The command palette is a great place to look for any kind of code editing functionality you might need. Synchronise your settings You can configure settings just for your workspace - as well as set global settings for all projects you work on. A handy feature of VS Code is Settings Sync, which lets you sync VS Code configurations such as settings, keybindings, and installed extensions to your GitHub account so that you can have the same setup across different machines, and if you have to do a fresh install of VS Code your settings are not lost. You can turn on Settings Sync from the Manage gear menu at the bottom of the Activity Bar: Extensions VS Code is set up to work out-of-the-box, but that is just the start! VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. Find the \"extensions\" icon on the left-hand bar and click it. You should see a search bar where you can search for extensions. Search for the Python extension (you can just search \"python\"), and install it. Look at the other icons on the left and other menu items to get a feel for what all is in VS Code. Python syntax highlighting and IntelliSense VS Code is a great editing tool for Python code and includes several features to help you be productive when writing code. Creating a new file with a \".py\" extension, e.g. \"my_script.py\". tells VS Code that this file is a Python file. However, in order for VS Code to run Python files, you must tell VS Code which version of Python to use. Select a Python interpreter From within VS Code, select an interpreter by opening the Command Palette ( Ctrl+Shift+P ), start typing 'Python: Select Interpreter', then select the command. The command presents a list of available interpreters that VS Code can find automatically, including virtual environments . You will see your Python version in the bottom right-hand corner: Note: When using Anaconda, the correct interpreter should have the suffix ('base':conda) , for example Python 3.7.3 64-bit ('base':conda) . If you activate your conda environment before opening your workspace in VS Code from the terminal, this should be automatically selected. Once your Python interpreter has been selected, VS Code knows to highlight the text using Python syntax highlighting rules. IntelliSense IntelliSense is a code completion aid. The user is given a list of options when they begin to type the variable named, greeting. IntelliSense generally opens automatically in most useful situations. You can also trigger it by pressing ctrl + space . Linting in VS Code Linting helps you identify and correct programming errors or unconventional coding practices in your Python code. For example, linting detects use of undefined variables, package imports that are not used, calls to undefined functions, missing brackets etc. You can easily toggle between enabling and disabling your linter, through the Command Palette ( Ctrl+Shift+P ), selecting the Python: Enable/Disable Linting command. Running code in VS Code Once you have selected a Python interpreter, there are several different ways to run Python code. You can run your Python script by clicking the Run Python File in Terminal play button in the top-right side of the editor. The button opens a terminal in which your Python interpreter is automatically activated, then runs your script. Terminal in VS Code VS Code includes an integrated terminal that starts at the root (highest point) of your workspace. To open the terminal: Use the Ctrl+` keyboard shortcut with the backtick character. Use the View > Terminal menu command. From the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), use the View: Toggle Terminal command You can create a new terminal via the Terminal menu with Terminal > New Terminal. You'll see a terminal open up in the bottom of VS Code. The integrated terminal can use various shells installed on your machine, with the default PowerShell on Windows. You can select other available shells to use in terminal instances or as the default such as Git Bash. In the terminal, you can execute your Python script by running: python my_script.py You can also add a path to your conda executable ( conda.exe in the Anaconda installation folder) in settings of VS Code. This is useful as then you can add new packages to your environment from within VS Code. Note: it is not recommended to add conda to your path on Windows. Interactive cells in VS Code VS Code allows you to easily run bits of your code through its integration with Jupyter. Jupyter is an open-source project that lets you easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on one canvas called a notebook. To work with this integration, you must install the Jupyter package in your base Python, and install the ipykernel package in an activated environment . You can then create and run Jupyter-like code cells, defined within Python code using a # %% comment: # %% msg = \"Hello World\" print ( msg ) # %% msg = \"Hello again\" print ( msg ) When the Python extension detects a code cell, it adds Run Cell and Debug Cell CodeLens buttons for you to manually run sections. For more information on interactive cells in VS Code, see the documentation . Note: for importing functions from other scripts to work, you need to set your Jupyter notebook root to be ${workspaceFolder} . Find this via Command Palette ( Ctrl+Shift+P ) and opening Settings. You also need to make sure that the Jupyter 'kernel' that starts when you run a cell is referencing your virtual environment . Interactive Python notebooks Jupyter notebooks are fantastic for exploration, but terrible for version control and can often lead to errors (for a thorough discussion of how Jupyter notebooks do not always fit into a reproducible development workflow see our comparison of IDEs and notebooks . VS Code supports using Jupyter notebooks natively as well as in your Python code via interactive cells. You can create, open and run Jupyter notebooks ( .ipynb files) from inside VS Code. Handily, you can also convert Jupyter notebooks to Python code files very easily from within VS Code. This means that you had develop and try out bits of code in a Jupyter notebook, and then convert it to Python code when you've got it working. Use the convert icon on the toolbar to convert the Notebook (.ipynb) file to a Python file (.py). Once you've converted the file, you can run the code as you would with any other Python file. This offers a more convenient way to find and resolve code bugs, which is difficult to do directly in a Jupyter notebook.","title":"Tools"},{"location":"implementing_RAP/workflow/tools/#_1","text":"Getting data science tools configured to your needs and working together is a core part of any data science project.

This is important because you can do lots of things from the terminal: run Python scripts, launch interactive notebooks, etc. You may also see this referred to as the 'shell'- there is a difference but the terms are often used interchangeably. Many computers only have a terminal , so you have to know how to use the terminal if you want to do things on them. For example: if you set up an instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, you'll need to interact with that machine via the terminal. There are many different terminals, but all of them do basically the same thing. Windows comes with a couple of default terminals that you can find using Windows search: CMD and PowerShell. Although these shells have some similarities with the shells that data scientists usually use (such as bash and zsh), CMD and PowerShell are different enough to sometimes cause issues. Many of the commands are different, and many of the programs that we might want to use can't be called through them. You're welcome to use these default shells if you want, but remember that the commands you find on StackOverflow may not always work. Different terminals use slightly different languages, and so you may find that if you're used to the terminal on a Mac, you need different commands when working on a Windows machine. Some terminals allow you to workaround this- such as Git Bash . Git Bash works on Windows, but emulates the most common terminal experience on a Mac or Linux, allowing to use the same commands.

TLDR RAP is not just a good idea - it's fast becoming the required way of working with data The government, the Civil Service, and the NHS have all released documents pushing for the RAP way of working These include The Goldacre Report, Data Saves Lives, and the Civil Service RAP Strategy Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note What is RAP? Helpful Knowledge of RAP principles will help you understand why the government is pushing for it The government wants you to adopt RAP principles in your analytical work. This is highlighted in a number of policy, strategy, review, and other documents pushing for the use of RAP in the UK public sector. Read on to find out how RAP is not just a good idea - it's fast becoming the required way of working with data. The Goldacre review Better, broader, safer: using health data for research and analysis aka \"The Goldacre Review\" is a 2022 report led by Prof. Ben Goldacre, offering guidance on how the NHS can better use, manage, store, and access its data. The 220-page report urges the adoption of RAP working principles, and offers detailed recommendations on how to do so. The report was fully supported by the Secretary of State for Health. Key quotes: The NHS can and should rapidly adopt RAP working practices, both for service analysis and for research. The principles of RAP are excellent, well thought through, and reflect a strong basic minimum standard . Promote and resource \u201cReproducible Analytical Pipelines\u201d (RAP, a set of best practices and training created in GDS and ONS) as the minimum standard for academic and NHS data analysis. Data Controllers should require RAP and open code sharing from data users. TREs (Trusted Research Environments) themselves should be built on principles of RAP and open code. Parliamentary Questions On 10 May 2022, Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne Central tabled a written question for parliament on the use of RAP to the Department of Health and Social Care: \"To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps he taking to promote and resource reproducible analytical pipelines as the minimum standard for academic and NHS data analysis, as recommended in the Goldacre review.\" The question was answered on 24 May 2022 by Gillian Keegan, Conservative MP for Chichester, who replied: \"We are currently considering the recommendations of the Goldacre review. However, many of the review\u2019s recommendations are aligned with existing programmes, such as facilitating Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) within the National Health Service and promoting RAP through NHS analyst communities.\" Data saves lives Data saves lives: reshaping health and social care with data , is a policy document released in 2022 laying out the government's plan to use data in healthcare. Key quotes: Recommendation 7: promote and resource \u2018Reproducible Analytical Pathways\u2019 (RAP, a set of best practices and training created in ONS) as the minimum standard for academic and NHS data analysis ...we will explore the impact and benefits of modern, open working methods of data management and analysis such as Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAPs), which is particularly recommended by the Goldacre review As we foster an increasingly open culture, we will progressively ask for more open-source ways of working in our procurement and contracts, with clear policies that build towards open by default across the NHS. We will begin to make new source code that we produce or commission open and reusable by default (with clear exceptions) and publish it under appropriate licences to encourage further innovation All accredited NHS secure data environments must adhere to a policy of open-working, support code-sharing and facilitate use of technology that supports this, such as RAPs. Recommendation 17: embrace modern, open working methods for NHS data analysis by committing to Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) as the core working practice that must be supported by all platforms and teams; make this a core focus of NHS analyst training. Secure Data Environment policy guidelines The Secure data environment for NHS health and social care data policy guidelines expand on the recommendations made in Data Saves Lives pertaining to how secure data environments should be implemented. It includes RAP in its definition of the \"Five Safes\" - specifically under Safe Projects, as publishing our code is needed for the public to understand how we're using their data. Key quotes: Code developed in secure data environments must be published in the open unless there is a specific rationale for not doing so. Secure data environments must support open working, ensuring that code developed in these environments is reusable [for example] using the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) strategy. Civil service RAP strategy The Civil Service RAP team produced a strategy report outlining why and how government departments should adopt RAP working principles. Key quotes: Embedding RAP as the default approach to analysis in government is an essential step on the way to digital transformation of analysis. ...we know that giving analysts the capability needed for RAP improves efficiency and the quality of their products. We have shown that RAP delivers improved efficiency and quality for analysis. RAP forms a core part of digital transformation and supports the delivery of other government initiatives. Government open source guidance One of the key RAP principles is transparency - sharing and reusing code. This speeds up the development of analytical processes, as you're not continually reinventing the wheel. If an existing solution exists elsewhere, why write one again from scratch? In 2017, the government released guidance on this in a document called When code should be open or closed . Spoiler alert: it should almost always be open. Key quotes: You should keep some data and code closed, including: keys and credentials, algorithms used to detect fraud, unreleased policy. You should open all other code. Proposed NHS open source policy Colleagues in the NHS created a proposed policy to inform why, how and when staff across NHS England should publish their code openly. Key quotes: All new source code that we produce or commission should be open and reusable by default: such that anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share the relevant code for any purpose. It is almost impossible for staff across the NHS to communicate either best practice or effective solutions to common problems without a framework in place. Open source code offers that framework. Any open code can be reused by our developers to reduce costs , avoid duplication of effort, generally increase staff efficiency , make system changes more quickly and pursue the best approaches, not just those locally available.","title":"Government policy on RAP"},{"location":"introduction_to_RAP/gov-policy-on-rap/#what-does-government-policy-say-about-rap","text":"TLDR RAP is not just a good idea - it's fast becoming the required way of working with data The government, the Civil Service, and the NHS have all released documents pushing for the RAP way of working These include The Goldacre Report, Data Saves Lives, and the Civil Service RAP Strategy Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note What is RAP?

Gold - Analysis as a product to further elevate your analytical work and enhance its reusability to the public. The levels of RAP maturity framework helps teams balance BAU delivery, resourcing constraints and other organisational objectives alongside RAP implementation. Which level should I aim for? The Baseline level is designated as the minimum standard of a RAP . Silver and Gold RAP help external users reuse code and support moving to a fully-automated solution. However they often require significant time and investment in upskilling. Many teams will aim for Baseline RAP in their first RAP attempt, and aim for Silver or Gold RAP for further releases. The different levels allow teams to tackle capabilities iteratively, rather than all at once. Initially aiming for Baseline or Silver RAP means that teams see some of the immediate benefits of RAP while having the time needed to learn new skills. It's important to balance the work required to implement RAP and the benefit you'll get (e.g. time & resource-saving); in other words, match the RAP level to the product. For example, some ad-hoc analysis products probably do not need to aim for silver or gold RAP.

This page describes what these principles are, and their benefits. Prefer a video? Then watch this 10 minute talk on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines given at the Health And Care Analytics conference. You can learn more about the history of RAP and why it was devised here: The History of RAP . The RAP Journey You can think of the implementing RAP like this: Many teams reach Step 3 and stop there, but it's important to continue on to Steps 4 and 5 - sharing and reusing code - to gain the full benefits of RAP. RAP Principles The RAP way of working isn't fixed and will evolve in line with new technologies and practices. Below are some of the core RAP principles at this time: Automation Anything that you do manually is time consuming, costly and prone to human error. For example, say you have some data that you export from a database table into Excel, and then you use vlookups to pull some reference data into it from another file. In this case, why not upload the reference data to the database, and update your script to do this automatically? Then that's one job you'll never have to do again! One of the first things you should do is identify any manual steps in your process, and automate them if possible. Process mapping is a good way to do this. Advantages: Faster processes : Much faster to get the computer to do all the work! More resource : Free up analyst time to work on other things Accuracy : Reduces the risk of human error Modular, re-usable code Code should be written in modular blocks that are essentially independent of each other. A non-software example might help explain this concept - imagine that your mouse was hard-wired into your computer. If you wanted a new one, it'd be a lot of work to change it, and a lot could go wrong in the process! As it is, your computer and your mouse are separate components with a standardised interface, meaning you can easily chop and change them. It's possible to write code in a similar way. This is sometimes called \"loose coupling\". Say you have process that imports some data, generates some counts, applies a suppression rule, and then exports the output. If you do this all in one script, we would say that these four processes are tightly coupled. They are not separate modules, and each part cannot run without the other parts. A better way would be to move these four processes into separate functions , which would be contained and organised in a logical project structure : import_data() generate_counts() apply_suppression() export_data() Note that each function just does one thing - this is called \"separation of concerns\". Then we simply pass the output of each function to the next. None of the functions depend on any other to work. For example, the generate_counts() function doesn't depend on import_data() . It doesn't even know that it exists. We could use a completely different import_data() function, or just pass a static CSV file. As long as it receives the data, it will work. So we say these functions are loosely coupled. Advantages: Avoid repetition : For example if you need to suppress counts in multiple places in your script, you can just call the function each time - no need to copy and paste the same code in several places Re-usability : Easier to re-use code in other work, speeding up the development of future projects Integration : Easier to \"slot in\" other people's functions - no need to reinvent the wheel if a solution already exists! Faster on-boarding : Code is easier to understand, so new users can get up to speed faster Easier to test : Testing is much easier to implement, improving the robustness and accuracy of the process Load balancing : In cloud architecture, it's easier to scale out computing resources for intensive modules and scale back in for the lighter ones Transparency The Government's Digital Service Standard 12th principle states that all publicly funded code should be open, reusable and available under appropriate licences. To achieve this transparency, we can save our code to public-facing repositories like GitHub. Learn more in our guide on publishing your code . Advantages: Improve public trust : through transparency of our processes Identify mistakes : More eyes on the code makes it more likely that mistakes will be spotted Feedback : Readers of the code are able to suggest and make improvements to it Collaboration : Increases collaboration and knowledge sharing Faster on-boarding : No time is wasted on requesting permissions or access to code repositories Consistent standards : Easier to share and align on standards across the health sector Code quality : Knowing that your code will be published, tends to improve the quality of the code that you write Re-usability : Help other teams, internal and external, improve their processes by re-using our code Alignment with government policy : A number of government policy documents and reviews are asking for this Use open-source tools Rather than proprietary software packages, use open-source software and programming languages like Python and R. Open-source basically means it's freely available for anyone to use. Advantages : Free : open-source tools are completely free to use Support : they tend to have a very active community of helpful people to seek advice and support from Reusability : anyone can run open-source code, you don\u2019t need to be a fellow user of a proprietary system. This makes it easier to share work across teams and organisations Use other people's code : Reusability goes both ways! We can take advantage of the libraries, packages, and other code made by others Flexibility : open-source programming languages can cover many bases \u2013 data connections, querying, processing, producing statistics, creating visualisations, building reports, and so on. This reduces the number of points where data is moved from one system to another Version control When you're working with code, you'll often want to keep track of the changes you make. That way, you can always go back to your previous version if your current changes don't work out. Doing this manually can lead to situations like the following: Version control software, such as Git, fixes this. It enables you to keep a detailed history of code changes, and easily roll back to previous versions. It also makes for easy collaboration, even when multiple people are working on the same file. Version control systems have become essential to anyone who writes code as part of their job. If you need some help getting started, have a look at our git guidance . Advantages: Auditability : Create an audit trail of changes made, logging what changes were made when and by whom Roll backs : Enable users to revert changes, or roll back to previous versions Enhanced collaboration : Makes collaboration on coding projects much easier Code quality : Makes it easier to peer-review code for quality and reliability Transparency : Enables code to be shared more easily, using cloud services like GitHub or GitLab. Automation : Automate parts of the development workflow, for example, running tests or auto-formatting code Good coding practices In RAP projects we should aim to write high-quality code that follows a logical structure, and is well-commented and documented. You can learn more about good coding practices in our Python programming guide and our refactoring guide . Advantages: Readability : Easier to read and understand the code \u2013 not just for third parties but also new team members Extensibility : Easier to extend and modify the process Integration : Easier to integrate code written by other people Testing Testing in a coding context means setting up automated procedures that check the code to find any mistakes, making sure it works well and does what it's supposed to do. This is one reason we should write code in modular functions. Each function will have a singular purpose, so we can test them in isolation, and when working together as a whole. If you find it difficult to know where to start in writing tests for your project, that may be a sign that your code isn't modular enough (see the section above on writing modular code ) The key here is that the tests are automated. In one click we can test the entire codebase. It's like a safety net, helping us feel confident that changes to one area of the code haven't had a knock-on effect anywhere else. To learn more, see our guidance on testing . Advantages : Spotting mistakes : Testing helps find and fix errors or bugs Enhanced reliability : Ensures that the process operates reliably under different conditions Accuracy : By reducing the risk of errors, we help ensure that the figures we release are accurate Time saving : It is usually easier to identify and fix issues early in development Peer Review Peer review involves collaborative examination of code and outputs by team members to ensure quality, correctness, and adherence to best practices. When changes are made to the code, these should almost always be reviewed by another team member - even if the new code is passing all the tests that have been created for it. This is because even when code is working correctly, there may be a way to make the code more efficient, or to make it easier to read. Furthermore, the tests themselves should be checked to ensure that they are truly testing what they are supposed to. This is another reason to use version control systems like Git and an accompanying cloud service like GitHub - they make the peer review and approval process much easier. Learn more in our page on code reviews . The page on publishing your code also describes a recommended code review process when making your code public. Advantages : Accuracy : Increases accuracy and performance of code Identify mistakes : Reduces risk of error Code quality : Ensure code is written to a high standard Training : Useful development exercise to help team members learn good practices The non-RAP way Let's compare this to the current state of play that we are trying to move beyond with RAP. Imagine a publication process that doesn\u2019t use the principles above. It might involve: Manually running queries against a data store to retrieve, join, and clean the data Exporting the data and manually importing it into another statistical or analysis package Creating some statistics/outputs Manually copying these to an Excel/Word/PDF report Of course, every publication will be different, and there will often be multiple strands of work going on that converge on the final report. But the gist is, a processes requiring a lot of manual steps, and usually using proprietary software. This has several downsides such as: Time consuming : manual steps are time consuming, not only to carry out, but because they introduce a point where further manual quality assurance (QA) is needed Potential for error : Fiddly manual steps introduce the possibility of human error. Lack of tests mean we can't be completely sure how future changes affect the old code Scalability : If you need to add a new table or statistic to the publication, the process will take longer to complete Difficult to extend : Code written on in a non-modular way using proprietary systems is harder to extend when changes need to be made RAP solves these problems (and others!) Imagine if the whole process described above, from retrieving data to creating the finished publication, could be completed in one click. That\u2019s what RAP aims to do. In many cases, a RAP approach can: Significantly speed up the process Reduce the risk of error by removing manual processing steps Increase robustness and improve QA through automated testing Increase transparency by making code public Create a modular, re-usable codebase that is easy to extend or modify Build a library of code that is easily shareable across projects We'll go into more detail on the benefits of RAP on our \u201cWhy RAP is important\u201d page. It\u2019s not all or nothing! It\u2019s not necessary to make all these changes at once! You can move along the RAP journey in stages, and you\u2019ll see benefits with each step. Start simple and build up over time. We have a page on Levels of RAP which explains more about this, with three levels - Baseline, Silver, and Gold. Successful implementation of RAP often begins by starting with Baseline and building up from there. In the beginning, you\u2019ll probably be best focusing on areas that reduce manual work for your analysts, freeing up their time so they can focus on other things.","title":"What is RAP?"},{"location":"introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/#_1","text":"TLDR RAP is a way of creating analytical processes that are: More efficient More robust More transparent RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines) is a set of principles and working practices that help you create faster, more robust, and more transparent analytical processes.

Below are some of the core RAP principles at this time:","title":"RAP Principles"},{"location":"introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/#automation","text":"Anything that you do manually is time consuming, costly and prone to human error. For example, say you have some data that you export from a database table into Excel, and then you use vlookups to pull some reference data into it from another file. In this case, why not upload the reference data to the database, and update your script to do this automatically? Then that's one job you'll never have to do again! One of the first things you should do is identify any manual steps in your process, and automate them if possible. Process mapping is a good way to do this. Advantages: Faster processes : Much faster to get the computer to do all the work! More resource : Free up analyst time to work on other things Accuracy : Reduces the risk of human error","title":"Automation"},{"location":"introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/#modular-re-usable-code","text":"Code should be written in modular blocks that are essentially independent of each other. A non-software example might help explain this concept - imagine that your mouse was hard-wired into your computer. If you wanted a new one, it'd be a lot of work to change it, and a lot could go wrong in the process! As it is, your computer and your mouse are separate components with a standardised interface, meaning you can easily chop and change them. It's possible to write code in a similar way. This is sometimes called \"loose coupling\". Say you have process that imports some data, generates some counts, applies a suppression rule, and then exports the output. If you do this all in one script, we would say that these four processes are tightly coupled. They are not separate modules, and each part cannot run without the other parts. A better way would be to move these four processes into separate functions , which would be contained and organised in a logical project structure : import_data() generate_counts() apply_suppression() export_data() Note that each function just does one thing - this is called \"separation of concerns\". Then we simply pass the output of each function to the next. None of the functions depend on any other to work. For example, the generate_counts() function doesn't depend on import_data() . It doesn't even know that it exists. We could use a completely different import_data() function, or just pass a static CSV file. As long as it receives the data, it will work. So we say these functions are loosely coupled. Advantages: Avoid repetition : For example if you need to suppress counts in multiple places in your script, you can just call the function each time - no need to copy and paste the same code in several places Re-usability : Easier to re-use code in other work, speeding up the development of future projects Integration : Easier to \"slot in\" other people's functions - no need to reinvent the wheel if a solution already exists! Faster on-boarding : Code is easier to understand, so new users can get up to speed faster Easier to test : Testing is much easier to implement, improving the robustness and accuracy of the process Load balancing : In cloud architecture, it's easier to scale out computing resources for intensive modules and scale back in for the lighter ones","title":"Modular, re-usable code"},{"location":"introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/#transparency","text":"The Government's Digital Service Standard 12th principle states that all publicly funded code should be open, reusable and available under appropriate licences.

As code has become ubiquitous, new ways of working have emerged to ensure that scientific findings are rigorous and reproducible. These practices have been applied to government analytic work under the banner of Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) . RAPs bring together a number of good practices to help ensure all published statistics meet the highest standards of transparency and reproducibility. Over time, all analytical work in NHS England (and across government) will be expected to adopt the RAP practices. For example, RAP practices are a key element needed in order to meet the standards of quality analysis set out in the Aqua Book guidelines, which revolve around analysis being reproducible, auditable, transparent, and quality assured. This adoption will take time and should not be considered as all-or-nothing. There are stages to RAP. Teams can take the journey one step at a time with support from this community. The benefits of RAP at NHS Digital The NHS Digital mission statement says: Our goal is to maximise the accessibility, quality and utility of health and care data while respecting privacy, transparency and ethics. This goal aligns closely with the three main benefits of reproducible research from a scientific perspective Alston and Rick, 2021 : \"Reproducible research allows others to learn from your work. Scientific research has a steep learning curve, and allowing others to access data and code gives them a head start on performing similar analyses.\" \"Reproducible research allows others to understand and reproduce a researcher's work.\" \"Reproducible research allows others to protect themselves from your mistakes.\" RAP therefore helps us to: Improve the transparency and ethics by showing our workings and giving users a way to feed back into our processes. Improve the accessibility of data by outputting data in a consistent, predictable, and accessible format for users. Improve the quality of data by ensuring good coding standards are applied. Improve the utility of data by sharing code. This shows users how the data have been produced and allowing them to reuse our code. Improve the reliability of data by automating manual steps where possible. Aims of RAP This community of practice aims to support teams in adopting RAP practices through: Developing learning materials including reusable templates: Most of the learning materials were initially adapted for the NHS England analytical environment, but most are applicable elsewhere. Offering support as teams establish new working practices: We offer in-person support to NHS England teams in the form of bespoke coaching sessions. We also co-ordinate informal weekly drop-in sessions (internal to NHS England) and host monthly workshops, where you can learn from others at different stages of RAP adoption, and get advice. If you would like to attend these please contact us . This work is prompted by the observations that teams can struggle to adopt RAP practices without support. While no one element of RAP is particularly difficult, learning several new skills at the same time as delivering BAU is challenging. Teams can struggle to protect time to embed these practices. (The Statistics Authority report on the barriers to RAP adoption is an excellent discussion of the challenges in rolling out RAP). Luckily, at NHS Digital we have strong senior support for RAP and several teams have already begun to adopt many of the practices included in RAP. Consequently, we already have a large pool of skilled, enthusiastic analysts who are willing to help others.

Initial considerations Identify a publication/product that needs taking through RAP process Fill out a pre-RAP questionnaire Identify people in the publication team who will learn RAP process (Product Owner in a team of ~4 analysts of varying skill levels) Identify people who can provide support (the RAP team at NHS England) through RAP transition Assess the team's existing capability Plan pre-RAP training Consider the appropriate level of RAP to aim for, taking skills into account Estimate timeline, consider pre-RAP training, and distance from BAU Set up a project management tool (e.g. Jira, Trello etc.) for tracking work and confluence space for documenting learning, agreed decisions Teams meet and ice breaker session to get to know each other. Set out the plan for the engagement, review roles and responsibilities, lessons learned from previous projects, etc. RAP pre-engagement questionnaire The analyst team needs to assess their ability to carry out a RAP project end-to-end by completing a RAP pre-engagement questionnaire . The questionnaire will contain a series of questions which will revolve around initial project considerations: Publication, state of the codebase Environment used for publication and RAP process Key pain points Team capability Issues with resources, time constraints, BAU Creating your RAP team Instead of embedding an entire team on a Python training course, it is recommended to split out the team into a smaller RAP taskforce, which can work faster and more efficiently on a RAP project. This can be beneficial when there's a larger team as the starting point causing BAU work to mount up to unmanageable levels if the entire team fully commits to training. The team's selection will be based as before on the varying skill levels as result of the RAP pre-engagement questionnaire. After the training and RAP project is completed, then analysts from the project team can carry over the new found RAP knowledge to other similar taskforces as RAP champions. Assessing capability Determine each team members ability to: Use Git (on either GitLab/GitHub) Python (or any other open source programming language) Code reviews This is recorded based on the basis of how experienced and comfortable they are using the above. This will help determine how many analysts require training and/or the amount of training that is required. Depending on the team's size, it might be challenging to train up 6 analysts at once for example. Skill requirements for Baseline RAP To achieve baseline RAP , we recommend analysts familiarise themselves with: An introduction to Git and version control Python (or R, SQL depending on your project) Using Pandas (or PySpark or any R package, depending on your project) Code quality and style guides Skill requirements for RAP in general As defined from the Government Analysis Function , there isn't a definite way to design a end-to-end RAP pipeline. Once baseline RAP has achieved the following are recommended as components to improving a RAP pipeline: Be able to use Git and GitHub/Gitlab, creating/cloning a repo, commits, pushing to a repo, handling branches, merge requests, merge conflicts Python (or R, SQL) Pandas or PySpark dataframes, merging tables, filtering, aggregation, grouping by Using code reviews Testing code (e.g. unit testing, backtesting etc.) Be able to create a repository with good project structure functions and/or code modularity error handling for functions documentation of functions project packaging code style, best coding practices input data validation logging of data and the analysis continuous integration (CI/CD) dependency management, environment management (yaml files, requirements.txt etc.) Training Training should start a few weeks at least before the RAP project's kick off date, depending on training requirements and modules to be taught. During this period, analysts who are new to Python or Git enrol on the respective course that introduces them to their topic of choice. If the RAP team is completely new to programming, we recommend to start training at least a month before the RAP engagement starts. Depending on the analyst team's capability, there are different training pathways responsive to different needs. For example, not every person on the analyst team will require training on Git as they might already be knowledgeable. Analysts new to programming and version control We recommend before the RAP engagement (example for Python/Pandas) for analysts to enrol on courses on: Git/version control Introduction to Python and programming (data types etc) Functions Pandas Familiarity with software engineering best practices, style guides (e.g. PEP8) Experienced users Object-oriented programming Unit tests Project structure Any from the beginner's training pathway During RAP Pair programming support During a RAP project (e.g. at the start of the thin slice ) it can be beneficial to set up coding buddy pairs, usually an experienced programmer with an inexperienced one, to form a mentoring style collaboration and in addition to help with troubleshooting code, version control, code reviews and any programming related questions. The level of engagement is up to the programming pairs, daily catch-ups for instance is often observed as a workable standard. We found this style of engagement beneficial to teams new to RAP and programming in general, as support from experienced programmers and experts on RAP can offer a significant impact on the success of RAP projects. How to run training during RAP project Once the RAP project commences, the first training session to carry out is: the Introduction to Git and Using Git Collaboratively . Each training session requires a support drop in session where analysts from the project team join in case they are stuck on any exercises from the guides. A repository set up for the purposes of practising Git is used and provided for practice. and basics of Python/Pandas. Using the project's data, we recommend to use data from your project to create a tutorial script that produces a basic output using our basics of Pandas guide and go over elementary Pandas operations that will beginners with their first coding steps. This could cover joins, group bys, filtering, selecting and renaming columns etc. Other training to consider running depending on your team's requirements. We suggest to use your project to create examples for any training you follow to make training feel natural and applicable to your team: Python functions . The thin slice refactoring stage offers a great opportunity to refactor reusable code into functions, and your team to be able to practice with writing functions. These functions can be used as example of an introduction to Python functions i.e. how to call functions, when to pass arguments, number of arguments, keyword arguments, return, pass, docstrings etc. How to do code reviews . Code reviews can be deceiving as someone who's new to code reviews understand that their work is being judged. It is recommended to hold a team code review session and review a few example scripts, using our guidelines and considerations to demonstrate how useful and invaluable code reviews can be in improving overall code quality while also developing your coding skills at the same time. Project structure session, how to package your code . A Python package is a way to bundle your code into a single thing that can be shared and reused. Our goal is to be able to share and reuse code across NHS England as well as externally. PEP8 and Linting . Linting is a tool that highlights programming errors, stylistic errors and bugs in your code. Each programming software has its own linting application, it is recommended to enable this feature as it helps avoiding this type of errors. Session on the thin slice concept and design . The thin slice concept can be hard to understand sometimes for inexperienced analysts so a session covering the thin slice approach is recommended. Debugging code using an IDE . Like linting, debugging using a programming software can be a feature of its own, it is recommended to help your team familiarise themselves with debugging to improve troubleshooting efficiency. How to measure progress We recommend using the RAP maturity levels as performance indicators to best capture a team's progress. These levels aim to offer teams a recommended maturity map for adopting RAP practices. We have seen that teams who skip the early capabilities struggle to make effective progress. These capabilities are independent and so you don't need to adopt all at once. Team leads should balance the BAU delivery, resourcing constraints, and RAP development as fits their agreed objectives. For example, if all members of the RAP project team are comfortable using version control (i.e. merge requests, merge conflicts, Git commands workflow), then using Git and GitLab can be ticked off as a KPI.","title":"Building team capability"},{"location":"our_RAP_service/building_team_capability/#_1","text":"This guide will detail what you need to consider before starting a RAP engagement.","title":""},{"location":"our_RAP_service/building_team_capability/#initial-considerations","text":"Identify a publication/product that needs taking through RAP process Fill out a pre-RAP questionnaire Identify people in the publication team who will learn RAP process (Product Owner in a team of ~4 analysts of varying skill levels) Identify people who can provide support (the RAP team at NHS England) through RAP transition Assess the team's existing capability Plan pre-RAP training Consider the appropriate level of RAP to aim for, taking skills into account Estimate timeline, consider pre-RAP training, and distance from BAU Set up a project management tool (e.g. Jira, Trello etc.) for tracking work and confluence space for documenting learning, agreed decisions Teams meet and ice breaker session to get to know each other.

This is quite a change in direction for a team that previously was focused on development. We've had to quickly reframe our approach to rolling out RAP in NHS England to reflect this change. The RAP service aims to support teams in adopting RAP practices through setting standards, providing reusable training and code, and through directly supporting teams as they progress along the RAP journey. This page discusses some of the tools and considerations we have used in trying to establish this new service. It has two main sections: service design and user research. Why treat RAP as a service? Many of the technical challenges around RAP are now largely solved. Version control, automated testing, peer review are all practices that are well understood and well documented. Nevertheless, adoption of these RAP practices across the public sector has been very slow. Barriers to RAP adoption are therefore likely to be caused by challenges and constraints faced by analytical teams themselves. It is vital for us to understand and address these barriers in order to achieve the RAP team's goal of supporting adoption of RAP practices. If we want to advance RAP across a large, resource-constrained organisation then we need a systematic way to tackle these barriers. The RAP service allows us to support teams to adopt RAP while also helping to prevent our work from being derailed by shifting scope or unrealistic expectations. Service design The government digital service has really nice guidance on how to design and establish a service. To start formalising the RAP service, we ran a series of guided workshops where we tackled these questions in sequence: What problem do we think our service is trying to solve? Who would be the users of the service? What are the needs of different users? A screenshot from the board where we tried to identify user needs. I've deliberately not made these images high-resolution enough to see the detail Once we reached a consensus on these users and their needs, we sketched out a service map for how the RAP team could meet the needs of these users. This service map runs from the first time users hear about our service all the way through to the point that we disengage from them. A screenshot from the board where we mapped out the service map including user experiences, pain-points, and our processes. I've deliberately not made these images high-resolution enough to see the detail At each stage in the journey, we set out the questions and feelings that the users might experience and we considered what tools or processes we might put in place to improve their experience. At the outset this was only a map - a proposed state of what we wanted to reach as a team. There was too much to implement all at once so we prioritised which elements of the service map were most important to tackle first. Critically, we do not treat the service map as a static artefact. After each engagement we conduct user research to identify which elements of the journey should be prioritised for improvement next. This iterative approach allows us to meet the immediate demand while also making progress towards our intended destination. The section below talks in more depth about the user research. User research The goal of our user research is to understand our users' challenges and needs. This discussion guide is intended to support that goal by enabling conversations engage with your participant and their interaction with the service. We have shared our template for user research below. The discussion guide is only a guide and conversations will often take their own course. More - the discussion guide should be adapted and improved to suit your own purposes. We usually have two people from the RAP team join the call. One person to lead the discussion and another to take notes. We also record the sessions so we can review it later as a team. Once we have gathered this user research, we review it as a team and revisit our service design map above. We think about the whole service journey in light of the findings and we consider what we need to improve for our next iteration. User research guides iterative improvements to the service So far, we have been able to make very substantial improvements after every single engagement. It feels very important that we continue to give ourselves the time and space to effectively concentrate on service improvement between engagements. We've included the discussion guide used for the user research sessions below. Are users of the RAP service the NHS England teams producing the publications or the end-users of the publications? This is a really tricky question that we've grappled with extensively. Where we've landed is that we are focussing on users of the RAP service - internal analysts. This decision is partly pragmatic - since we work with internal analysts everyday and can just ask them. Partly it reflects how NHS England is organised. We are part of an internal analytics function so other people have responsibility for the external user research. Nevertheless, the lack of user research is a failing of our approach currently. It would be extremely helpful to get more external user research as it motivates so much of the RAP work. The Department for Education led a very strong example of using research from the end users to motivate RAP adoption and drive development of their Explore Education Statistics tool . Download the Discussion guide Discussion guide (40 min) Day: Time: Interviewer: Note-taker: Interviewee: INTRODUCTION (2 minutes) Give some details about the purpose of the conversation and make sure your participant is comfortable with the set up, this will mainly be you talking at this stage. For example: Explain the purpose of the session: we want their input on how to improve the RAP service Let the participants know who is taking notes and who is leading the interview Let the participants know you are recording the session (if applicable) and make sure they consent Warm-up questions (5 minutes) Some straightforward questions to put the participant (and you) at ease and to make the conversation seem more natural; this section will establish the level of engagement your user has had with your service. For example: How long have you worked at [service]? Describe your role within the organisation? How did you first hear about RAP? Do you think this is something that we need to improve? What could we do to make it easier for people to find out? In your own words, what is RAP? How have you engaged with RAP overall and with the RAP team specifically? At the start of the project, did you have a clear understanding of what would happen during the engagement with the RAP team? What would help to give people a better understanding of the process in future? Engagement style (30 minutes) The main body of the conversation, where you will learn about your user\u2019s experience of working with your service, their needs, their pain points and where things work well. The RAP team provided support in the form of structured training sessions, pair coding support, and (help with) designing the codebase for the project (delete as appropriate). We are now going to ask you some questions about each of those engagements: What did you like about the training from the RAP team? What didn\u2019t you like about the training from the RAP team? What did you like about the pair coding support offered by the RAP team? What didn\u2019t you like about the pair coding support offered by the RAP team? [Question on support model, description of the support model, how successful was this approach?] [prompt- what did you like, what didn\u2019t you like?] Was the balance between the training/pair-coding/design (delete as appropriate) correct? Which would you like to have had more or less of? Resources Did you engage with any guides? Would you recommend any of these to others? What could we add to our current resources which would make them more helpful? Was there anything missing which you needed? Final thoughts What would you change about the overall approach? [prompt for any obstacles e.g. time, senior support] If relevant: How confident do you feel about maintaining the project? How confident would you feel about starting a new RAP project? Wrap up (3 minutes) Thank your participant for sharing their experience, knowledge, and time with you, making sure they are comfortable with what they have told you and that they can follow up with you at any time. Ask them if they are able to ask further questions by email, if there is anything you might have missed. If applicable, offer your participant the opportunity to be involved in later stages of the user-design process (e.g. prototyping). Note-taking tips It is important to make a record of the conversation that takes place. You should use a document that has plenty of space to take note of both the questions asked and the responses from your participant. You should try to record the exact words that your participant uses and try not to paraphrase or infer meaning into what they have said. It is important for the richness and value of your research that you take note of direct quotes from your participant.","title":"Service design and user research"},{"location":"our_RAP_service/service-design-and-user-research/#why-treat-rap-as-a-service","text":"Many of the technical challenges around RAP are now largely solved.

Who would be the users of the service? What are the needs of different users? A screenshot from the board where we tried to identify user needs. I've deliberately not made these images high-resolution enough to see the detail Once we reached a consensus on these users and their needs, we sketched out a service map for how the RAP team could meet the needs of these users. This service map runs from the first time users hear about our service all the way through to the point that we disengage from them. A screenshot from the board where we mapped out the service map including user experiences, pain-points, and our processes. I've deliberately not made these images high-resolution enough to see the detail At each stage in the journey, we set out the questions and feelings that the users might experience and we considered what tools or processes we might put in place to improve their experience. At the outset this was only a map - a proposed state of what we wanted to reach as a team. There was too much to implement all at once so we prioritised which elements of the service map were most important to tackle first. Critically, we do not treat the service map as a static artefact. After each engagement we conduct user research to identify which elements of the journey should be prioritised for improvement next. This iterative approach allows us to meet the immediate demand while also making progress towards our intended destination. The section below talks in more depth about the user research.","title":"Service design"},{"location":"our_RAP_service/service-design-and-user-research/#user-research","text":"The goal of our user research is to understand our users' challenges and needs.

More - the discussion guide should be adapted and improved to suit your own purposes. We usually have two people from the RAP team join the call. One person to lead the discussion and another to take notes. We also record the sessions so we can review it later as a team.

Nevertheless, the lack of user research is a failing of our approach currently. It would be extremely helpful to get more external user research as it motivates so much of the RAP work.

We have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how best to support teams to engage with RAP. One of our main take-aways is that the support model of the RAP team should be tailored to the context of the team being supported. We often identify three competing demands for RAP projects. Each of these goals is valid but would suggest different support models: Goal Solution Consequence We want to build this pipeline as quickly as possible Accept the most basic code that is functional despite lower code quality Code will be more difficult to run and maintain. Risk that tech debt may snowball until BAU delivery becomes impossible We want to build the best possible pipeline Hire a team of external specialists to do it for us Risk that the team becomes demotivated or does not understand the code We want to train our analysts to write good code Give analysts lots of defended time away from their day job with high-quality in-person training BAU delivery will slow down. May not be possible given resource constraints Different goals suggest different trade-offs between improvements to code, building capacity in the team, and the resourcing constraints on the RAP team We\u2019ve now tried out three different models of support: The RAP team provides technical leadership and training with analysts teams being mentored as part of the project The RAP team provides up-front training but analyst teams lead technical development A RAP champion in the analyst team provides training and technical leadership with support from RAP team You can think of these models along a spectrum with more hands on support for model 1 and much less support in model 3. The models are described in more detail here and in the section below, some considerations that can guide which approach is best are explained. 1. RAP team leads development In this model, we embedded fully with the team. The RAP team use our expertise to lead the planning and development process. We teach the team how to apply RAP practices to code through input sessions and pair coding. More than this - the analyst team adopts the working practices of the RAP team to also learn the workflow that goes along with these practices, e.g., breaking down code development into appropriately sized chunks of work for a short-lived branch. This model has worked very well \u2013 the analyst team get very good training and the RAP team get to apply their skills to improve the quality of the pipeline. The problem with this approach is how resource intensive it is as we might expect the RAP team to be embedded with a team for a couple of months. When we have hundreds of publications, this model doesn't scale well unless the teams then cascade their learning to others. 2. Analyst team leads development An alternative approach that we have tried was to offer tailored training and pair-coding support but to leave the technical design and leadership to the analyst team. A key benefit of this approach is the analyst team was really forced got to grapple with the code and think carefully about how to apply what they had learned from the RAP team. As a result I think they learned more effectively than would have been the case if they were shown. Conversely, in this model the quality of the code hit a ceiling. The analyst team did an excellent job at picking up skills and applying what they had learned to the code. Nevertheless, the experience to organise an entire codebase is not something that can be taught quickly. This outcome is peculiar - the team learned more effectively than they would have if given more guidance but also reached an upper limit sooner. One way for us to reconcile these contrasting situations would be to plan another round of engagement with the RAP team once the first round of learning has been consolidated. The most beneficial activity we undertook in this engagement was pair-coding. Supporting each person individually allowed us to manage the very different skill levels in the team more effectively, making sure each person was learning and making valuable contributions. 3. RAP Champion leads with support The third approach we have used is to identify a highly skilled individual in a team who wanted to lead on development work and then we focus our efforts on supporting that individual. This has been a very effective approach from the perspective of the RAP team as it is much less resource intensive. By focussing our engagement, we find that we can make faster progress towards a strong code outcome. The risk of focussing the engagement on one person is that they then assume primary responsibility for cascading the learning to the rest of the team. If they do not have time or inclination then you might end up leaving the rest of the team behind. The other problem with this approach is that it depends on teams already having that skilled individual. Offering a range of support based on the team's situation In order to choose the right support model for teams, we recommend that the team leads and RAP lead should discuss the considerations below. The discussion can frame the decision about whether to choose a support model that is more or less hands-on. Consideration Detail Decision Prioritise training the team or improving the code There is a tension between two outcomes of RAP - improving pipelines and training teams. The senior leadership team should make an honest, up-front decision about which to prioritise as this should guide the support model. Existing development skill in the team We have worked with teams at different stages of their learning journey. If the team is new to modern development practices then that would lean towards a more involved engagement from the RAP team. Team morale and enthusiasm for change Learning and implementing change is hard. For teams where morale is low, we recommend more engagement from the RAP team. Urgency for rebuilding the pipeline In situations where a pipeline is very burdensome or if there is a 'burning-platform' problem then you may choose to prioritise improving the pipeline, with team training coming later. The RAP team can work much faster to rebuild when not delivering training in parallel. Complexity of the existing pipeline For very complex pipelines, the RAP team will be more likely to make effective progress if they can lead development and tackle the pipeline directly. The stats team will likely learn most effectively in this scenario by following along with the refactoring process. Perceived risk of the existing pipeline If there have been a number of errors with a pipeline then you may want more intensive engagement from the RAP team. Resourcing constraints on RAP team We have seen that there is always more demand for RAP support than can be met. At the same time, spreading the RAP team too thin will lead to poor outcomes and consequently may risk the success of RAP overall in the organisation. You should consider carefully how many engagements the RAP team can support and prioritise publications appropriately. RAP is not a once-and-done process so it makes sense to build capacity out over time.","title":"Support models"},{"location":"our_RAP_service/support-models/#_1","text":"Every team approaches RAP from a different starting position - different BAU pressures, different team make-up and coding proficiency, different delivery cadence.

This is described fully in the github action that builds the website: pages-build-deployment Old release process (two repos, one private, one public) The release process below is no longer in use! The RAP Community of Practice now uses a very simple release process - fully coded in the open. This page mostly details our old release process, where we had a hidden \"dev\" repo, which published to this public repo on release - we're leaving this guide up here so people can learn from it and use it (it would be useful for more sensitive work) TLDR The RAP Community of Practice has embraced CI/CD by implementing an automated release process that uses GitHub Actions to move guidances written and reviewed in our private ( RAP_CoP_dev ) repository to the public ( rap-community-of-practice ) repository. The RAP Release workflow ensures control, flexibility, and consistency in the RAP CoP's releases. Key Steps: The contents of the release are copied from the private to the public repository. A pull request is created for the release for final merge approval to the main branch. The website pages are deployed using MkDocs when the release is merged into the main branch. Detailed YAML configurations and flowcharts explain each step in this RAP Release Workflow Guide. The RAP Community of Practice exists on two repositories. The public rap-community-of-practice , where anyone can view our guidance, and the private RAP_CoP_dev , where guidance is written and reviewed before being published to the public repository. The public repository is then converted using MkDocs to HTML and hosted by GitHub pages as our RAP Community of Practice website . The RAP Release Workflow allows the RAP Team to: Automate a repetitive but simple process with manual intervention Control when the release process occurs Easily maintain and change the process if required The release process uses GitHub Actions to execute. GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows automation of processes. A highly beneficial feature of GitHub Actions is the ability to automatically run workflows when events happen in your GitHub repository; in our case, when a release is published, a branch is pushed to, a pull request is closed and merged, and a directory is updated. The GitHub Actions are written using the YAML markdown language to execute, in this case: Pre-defined GitHub Actions, such as actions/checkout@v3 . Shell scripts that run Bash, git, and GitHub CLI commands. Other functionality, like setting up and using Docker containers, can be explored in the GitHub Actions documentation . The process is made up of four distinct steps. One that runs on the private RAP_CoP_dev and the other three that run on the public rap-community-of-practice . The first figure below shows a Git Flow Overview of the deployment process and where the four actions are involved. The second figure below shows a flowchart of the release process, roughly summarising the steps within the actions. Info For clarity and simplicity, the Git Process diagram shows Action 3 executing before Action 4. They will execute roughly simultaneously in practice, although slightly different events trigger them. The Release Process Flowchart (below) more accurately depicts the process flow. Action 1 - Copy Release to Public RAP CoP Repo Action 1 is kicked off by creating and publishing a release to the private RAP_CoP_dev . The release tags the repository with the semantic version number, e.g. v1.2.3. Action 1 can also be manually dispatched in GitHub (or via an API call) due to the addition of the workflow_dispatch event trigger. on: release: types: [published] workflow_dispatch: Action 1 executes one job, called copy-release . This job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu available through GitHub Actions, denoted by the runs-on: key. It is possible to run multiple jobs, some that run in parallel. GitHub Actions provides the conditional if key to control when a job executes. Here, we only want it to execute in the private RAP_CoP_dev , so we check if the action is executing in it. If it weren't here, it would trigger this action again when we eventually publish a release in the public rap-community-of-practice . Instead, it will skip running this job when running in the wrong repository. jobs: copy-release: runs-on: \"ubuntu-latest\" if: github.repository == 'NHSDigital/RAP_CoP_dev' The push-release job contains nine steps. Step 1 - Checkout private The first, Checkout private , uses the pre-existing actions/checkout@v3 action provided by GitHub. This action clones a repository (by default, the repository the action is executing in) and configures git to be ready to use in the Action's running environment. The with: key allows users to specify settings for executing the actions/checkout@v3 . In this case, there are three, token and path . token is used to set the Personal Access Token (PAT) that is used to configure git in the running environment. It is used not only to checkout the code but also in future git commands. By default, it uses ${{ github.token }} , which is a automatically generated PAT with access scoped to the Action's current repository. We need to access another repository in later steps, so we use ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} . This is stored in the repositories' secrets . path specifies the relative path to place the repository. Usually, it is the current directory ( path = '' ). However, we want to checkout two repositories, which means we will set it to private to put it in that folder. steps: - name: Checkout private uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} path: private Step 2 - Checkout public With the private RAP_CoP_dev repository checked out, we move on to the second step of the push-release job, which checks out the public rap-community-of-practice repository into the folder public . Like above, we set token and path to the ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} and public , respectively. However, we also set repository to NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice . This is the repository we want to checkout. By default is the current repository the action is running in, ${{ github.repository }} , but in this step, we are checking out the public repository, so set the value as specified. - name: Checkout public uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} repository: NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice path: public Step 3 - Read the release name and save it to the environment The third step of the copy-release job reads the latest release name for the private repository using the GitHub CLI . This is all done using the run: key that allows Bash shell code to be run. The | enables multiple lines of code to be executed together. The second line does a number of things: It uses the GitHub CLI command gh release view without a specified release tag to read the latest release from the current GitHub repository. The --json name flag argument will result in the being a JSON object that only includes the release name. The returned JSON object is then piped into the jq command-line JSON processor, which extracts the name key, with the -r flag returning it as a raw string with no quotation marks. The name string is then assigned to the RELEASE_NAME variable and then echoed out to the action's environment, $GITHUB_ENV , where later steps can access it. The second line builds the RELEASE_BRANCH variable by prefixing 'release/' to the RELEASE_NAME . This is standard practice to denote the branch type clearly. Line three creates the release branch, with the following lines pushing the branch and setting the upstream to the private (alias origin ) and public (alias public ) remote repositories. GitHub CLI can be configured to authenticate using the gh auth login command or will use the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable. The environment variable is used and set with the env:GITHUB_TOKEN key to use the EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN PAT. The default GITHUB_TOKEN could also be used but is not used for consistency with earlier steps. - name: Read the release name and create a branch. Push branch to private and public. run: | RELEASE_NAME=$(gh release view --json name | jq -r '.name') RELEASE_BRANCH=release/$RELEASE_NAME git branch $RELEASE_BRANCH git push -u origin $RELEASE_BRANCH git push -u public $RELEASE_BRANCH env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} Action 2 - Create Pull Request for Release Branch Action 2 is kicked off manually with a workflow_dispatch event or a push to a branch matching the pattern release/* . Therefore, Action 1 should trigger Action 2. on: push: branches: - release/* workflow_dispatch: Action 2 has a single job, create_pr , which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu available, like Action 1. It has a conditional if statement that checks that it is running in the public rap-community-of-practice repository. It does not need to run on the private RAP_CoP_dev repository, as the release branch is a snapshot of the current main repository. jobs: create_pr: runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: github.repository == 'NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice' The create_pr job has two steps. The first step is to checkout the current repository using actions/checkout@v3 . As the event was triggered by a push to release the branch, that branch will be checked out by default. A fetch-depth of 0 is used to get the complete commit history and allow git to determine the differences between the release branch and the main branch on the public rap-community-of-practice repository. steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: fetch-depth: 0 The next step runs the GitHub CLI command gh pr create to create a pull request to merge the release branch into main. The --fill flag will prompt the command to use the commit info to populate the pull request's title or body. If there is one commit, the commit summary will be the title. If there are multiple commits, the branch name is used as the PR title. Like in Action 1, the GitHub CLI commands use the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable to authenticate; however, Action 2 does not need to access another repository at any point, so the automatically created GITHUB_TOKEN can be used. - name: Create Pull Request run: | gh pr create --fill env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} The pull request must be manually reviewed and approved before it is merged into the main branch. Approving the pull request will trigger Action 3, and updating the docs directory on the main branch will trigger Action 4. Action 3 - Create a Release Action 3 is only triggered when a pull request is closed. This is because it requires the Pull Request's source branch to name the release branch. on: pull_request: types: - closed Action 3 has one job, release-if-merged , which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. There are a number of conditions that all need to be met to ensure that the action executes: github.event.pull_request.merged == true ensures that the Pull Request was closed with a merge, not for another reason (e.g. the branch was deleted) startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release/v') ensures that the source branch for the Pull Request was a release branch. github.repository == 'NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice' ensures that the release is being created in the correct repository, the public rap-community-of-practice . It should not execute in the private RAP_CoP_dev repository as it already has the release. jobs: release-if-merged: if: | github.event.pull_request.merged == true && startsWith(github.head_ref, 'release/v') && github.repository == 'NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice' runs-on: ubuntu-latest The first step of release-if-merged uses the default actions/checkout@v3 as the standard token can be used, as only the current repository is accessed, and a snapshot of the current repository state is needed ( fetch-depth: 1 ) to create the release. steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v3 The next step of the release-if-merged repository extracts the version information from the source branch of the Pull Request, which is stored in the HEAD_REF environment variable HEAD_REF . It then assigns it to the locally scoped RELEASE_NAME variable. The GitHub CLI command gh release create is then run, which creates a release. The RELEASE_NAME variable is then used to provide the tag value and the title of the release, with the rest of the release automatically populated. Two environment variables are defined for this step: GITHUB_TOKEN , which uses the automatically generated PAT HEAD_REF , which captures the head_ref value that is assigned when a pull request triggers an action. - name: Get Release Name from PR Branch Name and create a release run: | RELEASE_NAME=${HEAD_REF//release\\//} gh release create $RELEASE_NAME -t $RELEASE_NAME env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} HEAD_REF: ${{ github.head_ref }} A release with the matching version to the release on the private RAP_CoP_dev repository should now be published on the public rap-community-of-practice repository with the changes made since the last release. Action 4 - Build and Deploy Website Pages Action 4, is triggered on a push to the main branch with changes to the docs directory. It can also be triggered manually via a workflow_dispatch. on: push: branches: - \"main\" paths: - \"docs/**\" workflow_dispatch: This action only has one job, deploy , which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. No conditions are used, meaning the action can run on both the public rap-community-of-practice and private RAP_CoP_dev repositories. We don't mind if the action runs on the private repository; it is more of a nice-to-have, but the action must run on the public repository to ensure the RAP Community of Practice website is updated. jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest The repository is checked out with the actions/checkout command with the default settings as the first step of the deploy job. steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 The second and third steps set up the Python environment. Step two, actions/setup-python , installs python into the GitHub Action environment. The version specified by the python-version key, with the 3.X specification, which is the latest stable major version of Python 3. Step three calls pip, the in-built Python package manager. Pip is instructed to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. This file includes the packages required to run MkDocs in the next step. - uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with: python-version: 3.x - run: pip install -r requirements.txt The final step runs mkdocs gh-deploy , which commands MkDocs to build the RAP Community of Practice website from the markdown pages in the public rap-community-of-practice repository and then push to the gh-pages branch. This branch is then used to display the website via GitHub pages . Three flags are parsed with the command: --force : Forces the push --clean : Removes old files from the website that are no longer in the mkdocs.yml file. --verbose : Provides a more verbose command output for debugging. - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force --clean --verbose Alternative RAP Release Workflow Info This section of the documentation outlines a previous attempt at implementing an automated release process. This process relied on adding the target public repository as a temporary additional remote to the source private repository. Unfortunately, this process failed to work as the git histories were incompatibly different and weren't like forks of each other. This led to the current process detailed above being developed, which bypasses this issue completely. While it is not used in the RAP Community of Practice, it is still a viable deployment method for repositories with a common git history. Therefore, we have provided the documentation for this process. The process is made up of 4 distinct steps. One that runs on the private RAP_CoP_dev and the other three that run on the public rap-community-of-practice . The first figure below shows a Git Flow Overview of the deployment process and where the four actions are involved. The second figure below shows a flowchart of the release process, roughly summarising the steps within the actions. Info For clarity and simplicity, the Git Process diagram shows Action 3 executing before Action 4. They will execute roughly simultaneously in practice, although slightly different events trigger them. The Release Process Flowchart (below) more accurately depicts the process flow.

By default, it uses ${{ github.token }} , which is a automatically generated PAT with access scoped to the Action's current repository. We need to access another repository in later steps, so we use ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} . This is stored in the repositories' secrets . fetch-depth specifies the number of previous commits to fetch, which by default is 1. This is called a shallow fetch and is normally perfectly fine as it provides a lightweight snapshot of the current repository state. However, a shallow fetch is undesirable here because when we push the release branch to the public rap-community-of-practice repository, git will not have sufficient commit history to compare differences between the incoming release branch and the current state of the main branch. steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: token: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPO_TOKEN }} fetch-depth: 0 With the private RAP_CoP_dev repository checked out, we move on to the second step of the push-release job, which adds the public rap-community-of-practice repository as a new remote with the alias public . This will allow us to push (and fetch) from both repositories. git remote -v provides debugging information by printing the currently set remote repositories. It should show the private and public repository URLs with fetch and push permissions using the origin and public aliases, respectively. - name: Add the public repository as a remote run: | git remote add public https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice.git git remote -v The final step of the push-release job reads the latest release name, creates a branch named after the release, and pushes that branch to both repositories. This is all done using the run: key that allows Bash shell code to be run. The | enables multiple lines of code to be executed together. The first line does a number of things: It uses the GitHub CLI command gh release view without a specified release tag to read the latest release from the current GitHub repository.

The returned JSON object is then piped into the jq command-line JSON processor, which extracts the name key, with the -r flag returning it as a raw string with no quotation marks.

Other methods of assignments must be used if assigned to the broader Action environment The second line builds the RELEASE_BRANCH variable by prefixing 'release/' to the RELEASE_NAME .

Setup for Git Basics exercise Creating your access token on GitHub There is an excellent step by step guide on How to Create your Access Token on GitHub by GitHub Docs. The process is exactly the same as GitLab (see credentials for GitLab ), simply input your GitHub username and access token to verify your credentials. When selecting the access token's scope, the default options that should be ticked are: repo, admin:repo_hook and delete_repo. Do not forget to paste/save your access token somewhere safe as you won't be able to access it again. Video: How to create an access token on GitHub Here's a video on how to create the access token on GitHub: Access token video HTTPS vs SSH key You might come across SSH protocol keys, as it is essentially another option to create a password and verify your credentials. This section on HTTPS vs SSH protocol options of setting up credentials on GitHub explains the differences between these two options. There are pros and cons for both, we would recommend the HTTPS option for Git beginners. Troubleshooting credentials You might see something like this at any point: remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied remote: You must use a personal access with 'read_repository or 'write_repository' scope for Git over HTTP. remote: You can generate one at https:// etc etc... remote: Authentication failed for 'repository address you're attempting to git clone' This can mean a number of things: either your access token has expired or you have entered the wrong access token for your password (or username even). If your access token has expired or about to expire, you can check by going to Gitlab Profile -> Preferences -> Access Tokens then scroll all the way down and see if there\u2019s an Active Access Token and check the expiration date. These steps will help you fix your access to the repository: To fix this we need to create a new access token (don\u2019t assign a date this time, so it will never expire). In the command terminal type git pull -v (v stands for verification). This should prompt a new Git credentials window. If you don't have an existing repository, and can't do step 2, then: In the terminal type git clone <git repo's copied clone url> but with the new credentials included in the URL, so: C:\\My_documents>git clone https://<username>:<password>@<domain>/example.git So, in my case it would be: C:\\My_documents>git clone https://<username>:<MY_NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>@<domain>/example.git Exercises 1 - 6 Accessing a Git repository, creating a branch, adding a new file, uploading your changes to GitHub Getting started - tasks 1 and 2 will be relevant only when accessing a repository for the first time . Solution to exercises 1 - 6 (Using RStudio Desktop): Here's the video solution to exercises 1-6: Video exercises solution Using RStudio Desktop 1. Creating your local Git repository folder i. Open a Command terminal. This can be any terminal, Anaconda Prompt or Git Bash etc. To access the terminal, click the Search option on the Windows toolbar and type \"Anaconda Prompt\" and open it. The file directory address that's displayed in the terminal will usually be the default top level C drive address or something similar. (base) C:\\Windows\\system32> ii. Create a folder in your local directory, this is where the GitHub (remote) repository will be copied/downloaded to. In the Anaconda Prompt terminal type cd <windows explorer repo folder address you just created> , cd stands for Change Directory, and what this means is that the default terminal address will be directed to the new directory, the new folder address. Any Git commands applied in the terminal will apply to the current directory. (base) C:\\Windows\\system32>cd C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\my_project_folder\\demo (base) C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\my_project_folder\\demo> 2. Git clone (copy a GitHub repository) If you're using GitLab instead of GitHub, these steps will help you set up. i. The repository's clone URL will be on the GitHub repository's main page (see image below). ii. Type git clone <repository's clone url> the git-demo repository using your local terminal. Enter your credentials when prompted (GitHub username and access token for the password.) (base) C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\my_project_folder\\demo>git clone <paste the repo url address from the image above> iii. Type cd <windows explorer repo folder address> (open the newly downloaded git folder) in the terminal to assign the root level of the directory to the top level of the repository. This because the terminal is assigned to the folder containing the Git repository, not the folder that IS the Git repository. iv. Type git status in the terminal. You should see the this message: 3. Create and switch to a new branch Notice how in the image above, the first line says \"On branch main\". In Git, \"main\" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called \"main\" branch. This means that \"main\" can be seen as a repository's \"default\" branch. The main branch should always be locked, to protect the main build of your working code and/or documentation. To add new code/documentation/make any edits to the main branch, you need to submit a pull request . \"Branch\" is another word for \"version\". Usually when developing a document or slides for a presentation, we could have numerous versions of the same slides, with small or major differences. By using different branches (or versions) of the same code, we can safely work and test without breaking the publication code, that resides in the default master branch of the repository. i. To create a new branch , head over to GitHub, on the repository's main page, same webpage we used to find the Git clone repository's URL. To create a new branch on GitHub simply click on the \"main\" button underneath your repository's title. ii. Once in the dropdown menu, type in the branch's new name and hit Enter. You should now have a new branch, copy of the main branch. iii. In the above image notice how it points the original branch we are copying from, in grey letters: from \"main\". If you wish to create a new branch, which will be a copy from a different branch to \"main\", then set the repository to the branch you wish to copy from and then repeat steps i. and ii. iv. Back to the terminal (e.g. Command Prompt/Anaconda Prompt/Git Bash etc.), type git branch -a to view a list of all available branches existing in the repository. The branches that contain the remote/ path are the branches online, on GitHub. Have a look at the list. You will notice your new branch is not there yet. To update your local master branch with all the latest updates on Gitlab, type git pull . Type git branch -a and you should see your branch available in the list now. v. To start working on your branch and select, type in the terminal git checkout <your branch name> . vi. Type git status and this way you can confirm that you are in a new branch. Git will display a message showing the current branch name and the current branch's information. Reminder: any changes you make while in the main branch won't be uploaded to GitHub, as the main branch is protected and locked, so make sure you are in your own working branch! You can confirm this with step vi. above. Branch naming strategy Following an agreed naming convention will make it much easier to keep the team's work organised. We follow use this approach: <project_id>_<initials>_<ticket_number>_<brief-description> Here the project_id refers to our project ID in confluence (DS218). The initials are from my name. The ticket number refers to the jira ticket number. E.g.: DS218_CQ_167_Add-field-definitions Naming branches in this way helps to make it very clear what change should be happening in the branch. Sometimes code review will reveal that a branch that was intended to make one specific change in fact makes several changes. This should be avoided and the code review should reject the additional changes. 4. Add a new file By adding a new file to the project, you can avoid conflicts as each analyst will create and upload their own file. There are many ways to add a new file to your branch. One way is to upload a file directly to your branch on GitHub. The easiest way is to simply create the file (any type of file) in your working directory, while in your branch. You can also copy a file from another directory. The file you create or copy can be any type of file. For this exercise, create a file while in RStudio, with simply right-clicking on the repository's folder and then selecting the Create New File option: To view and edit the repository's folders and files in RStudio: i. Open RStudio ii. On the top toolbar go File -> New Project, this will open a Create New Project dialogue. iii. In the Create New Project dialogue, select existing directory (since we have already cloned the GitHub repository to your local machine and have a folder) and in Location select the Open Folder icon to select the existing folder repository and click Create Project. iv. You should be able to see the project structure on the lower right hand side window as it is displayed on GitHub. v. On the top toolbar select File -> New File -> Rscript and save the file somewhere in your repository (don't forget to name your Rscript!). vi. Add something into that file, a simple print statement or a comment. vii. Save it on RStudio. Tip: RStudio will have created a .Rproj/.Rhistory configuration file when you create an R project. To avoid having this uploaded to GitHub, a .gitignore file that contains those file formats will automatically block them from being pushed to the repository. See .gitignore for more information. 5. Commit your changes (follow standard Git command workflow) In the Anaconda Prompt (or any terminal of your choice) type the following. I suggest you read through the git messages displayed after each command entered in the terminal, to familiarise yourself with the logic. i. Type git status to see the modifications that haven't been staged yet (in red colour). ii. Type git add <filename> to stage your changes. Or git add . to simply stage all changes automatically (use with caution). iii. Type git status to see the file modifications now have a green colour. This means that Git add was successful. iv. Type git commit -m \"your commit message here\" to commit these changes. v. Type git status to view the status of your repo. There should be no modifications visible (or colours!). vi. Type git push . This command will upload all your committed changes to GitHub. 6. Check the repository on GitHub to view the changes updated Simply head over to GitHub, and the repository page on GitHub, select your branch and compare the changes between your branch and the master branch. Using RStudio Cloud To use GitHub with RStudio Cloud and not RStudio desktop, first create an account with RStudio Cloud. RStudio Cloud has a detailed guide on how to create projects, how to manage workspaces within the Cloud, how to handle permissions and teaching spaces. To create a project from GitHub, select the \"Your Workspace\" option on the left hand side once in RStudio Cloud and select New Project on the far right of the top toolbar, in the Your Projects space. This will open a new dialogue that will ask for the Git Repository URL, this is the URL you copy, as described in Step 2 of this guide. You will be prompted to enter your username (GitHub username) and your password, which is the access token created from the Create Access token step . Once the Git repository is deployed, you will notice the repository file structure on the right hand side panel. Steps 3 , 4 and 5 will be the same, the only change being that instead of using your local terminal to input Git commands, you will be using the RStudio Cloud built-in terminal. How to submit a pull request Pull request (PR) is the application you submit on the GitHub repository, to announce to other collaborators working on the repository that you have a new change ready to be merged/part of the main build, the main branch of the repository. Then, either your collaborators or someone you assign will review the change and the branch you have been working on to determine whether the change is ready to be merged with the main branch. The equivalent term for GitLab users is Merge Request (MR). To submit a pull request: Simply head over to GitHub and to the respective repository Select Pull requests on the top bar menu. Either select New Pull Request (big green button) on the right hand side or select Compare & pull request if you recently pushed new changes to the branch. Base ref will default to the main branch, head ref will be the branch you wish to merge with the main branch. You can change any of these options, there will be occasions you won't always aim to merge every branch to the main branch. Click Create Pull Request. Fill out any information related to the Pull request, title, description, any comments. On the right hand side you can assign yourself as the Assignee, and assign someone in your team to be the Reviewer. Then, select Create Pull Request. How to accept a pull request Once you are assigned the pull request's reviewer, you should receive an email notification from GitHub with a link to the pull request's webpage. You can also view any active pull requests by clicking on Pull Requests on the top bar menu. On the Pull request page, there are four tabs: Conversation, Commits, Checks and Files changed: Conversation Conversation is the main pull request page. It contains the pull request's description, timeline and comments left by the assignee or reviewer. To merge a pull request you have 3 presented options: Merge pull request: this will keep all commits history of the source branch and will be added to the target branch. Creates a symbolic commit. Squash and merge: ticking this will merge the history of commits for the source branch into one commit. This can be useful when the pull request is not a major update and you don't want your repository's history of commits to contain commits with messages such as \"fixed typo\", \"replaced incorrectly placed image\". Creates a symbolic commit. Rebase and merge: adds all source branch commits in front of the target branch's commits. Does not create a symbolic commit. Commits Commits tab displays a history of the pull request's commits. So for example, if the reviewer decides that minor adjustments are required and the assignee pushes these changes to Gitlab, then these commits will be captured in this tab. Files changes Files changed tab, here you can see all the new changes in the pull request's source branch. You can also opt for a side-by-side comparison, and see line-by-line how the master version and new branch version compare. You can also leave comments on each file's line, which will also be recorded in the Conversation tab's timeline. Checks Checks is part of the GitHub Actions functionality, which enhances your code review processes with apps and automated reviewing checks. This is inactive on default. If you are happy to merge the two branches, then select the type of Pull Request you wish to apply and the pull request should be completed in a few seconds. How to update your local main branch to the latest remote main version on GitHub/GitLab Open the Anaconda Prompt terminal or Git Bash or any other terminal you wish to use. This can be accessed by typing, for example Anaconda Prompt, in the search bar, after opening the search icon on your Windows toolbar. Type cd <paste your work directory address> in the terminal to switch to your working directory. This is where the Git repository is cloned/copied/downloaded to, on your local machine (or RDS environment or any environment you're using). This will cause the default terminal address to be directed at the new directory. (see Git Clone instructions above for more info) Type git status in the terminal to ensure that ii happened successfully and you are on the default main branch. You should see this message: Type git pull to update your local main branch with the latest version of the remote/online GitHub main branch. This might take a few seconds. (Optional) 5. If you're in a different branch and not the main branch, then type in the terminal git checkout main and then git status to confirm you are on the main branch.

In Git, \"main\" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server, the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called \"main\" branch. This means that \"main\" can be seen as a repository's \"default\" branch. The main branch should always be locked, to protect the main build of your working code and/or documentation. To add new code/documentation/make any edits to the main branch, you need to submit a pull request . \"Branch\" is another word for \"version\". Usually when developing a document or slides for a presentation, we could have numerous versions of the same slides, with small or major differences. By using different branches (or versions) of the same code, we can safely work and test without breaking the publication code, that resides in the default master branch of the repository. i. To create a new branch , head over to GitHub, on the repository's main page, same webpage we used to find the Git clone repository's URL. To create a new branch on GitHub simply click on the \"main\" button underneath your repository's title. ii. Once in the dropdown menu, type in the branch's new name and hit Enter. You should now have a new branch, copy of the main branch. iii. In the above image notice how it points the original branch we are copying from, in grey letters: from \"main\".

Your aim is to make the code more readable, more maintainable, more reusable, and more efficient. If you don't refactor your code, it can become increasingly more difficult and time-consuming to maintain over time. In this article you will learn golden rules on what good code looks like, and examples of \"code smells\" which indicate when code might need refactoring. Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note Coding Best Practice Helpful Some basic coding skills will help Refactoring is the art of rewriting your code in a way that improves it, without changing what it does. In RAP terms, that means improving our code without changing the output of the pipeline. Why refactor? Why would you bother re-writing existing code? If it works, it works, right? In the coding world, getting something to work is often considered just the first step in the development process. Then we make it better, and faster. Here\u2019s why: Readability : we spend more time reading code than writing it, so make it easy to read Easier to modify and test : well written, modular code is easier to modify and easier to write tests for, saving time in future development efforts Quicker on-boarding : when code it well-written, new team members will get up to speed more quickly Improve performance : finding ways to make our code run faster and use less computing resource (e.g., memory, disk space) Save the NHS money : cloud computing is charged on a pay-as-you-go basis \u2013 efficient code is cheaper Switch platforms : in RAP we aim to move from proprietary platforms to open-source tools Image source: Monkey User Refactoring Golden Rules Whole books have been written on refactoring, so we can\u2019t cover everything here. However, here are some refactoring \u201cgolden rules\u201d that should serve you well. Some of these are python specific, but most are universal no matter what language you\u2019re using. Filter and select early When you read data from CSV files or database tables, be sure to take only the rows and columns that you need. Superfluous rows and columns will slow down your processing. Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself (DRY) If you have the same code pattern repeated in multiple places, extract it into a function. Then simply call the function in the places where the repeated code used to be. This way, if you need to change this bit of code, you only need to change it in one place. Modularise your code Going further, even parts of your code that are only used once can be wrapped into functions! This has several advantages: It is easier to test It helps you organise your code, as related functions can be grouped into files or moved into classes You can reuse your code in other projects more easily Avoid long files Once you've got your code into functions and grouped into files, check that they are not too long. How long is \"too long\", is a bit subjective. Pylint recommend 1000 lines, which is OK as a starting point but sometimes you won't be able to avoid going longer, and that's OK. But when your files start to reach this length, see if the content might be better organised if it were broken into separate files. Improve your functions Functions should: Do one thing aka have a \u201csingle responsibility\u201d Be small Small functions are easier to test and maintain. Have as few parameters as possible Functions with lots of parameters are harder to understand and exponentially harder to test. If your functions don\u2019t meet these criteria, see if you can split them up. To help others understand your functions, you should also: Add docstrings Add type hints Use loose coupling where possible Tight coupling means that different components depend on each other, such that a change in one will often mean you need to make a change somewhere else. This can make it slower and more difficult to make changes to your code, and makes your code less reusable. Loose coupling means that the different functions, modules, and components can work essentially independently of each other. For example, say you have two functions. get_patient_data() gets patient data from a database and stores it in a dataframe. rename_patient_data() takes that dataframe, renames some columns, and returns it. These functions are tightly coupled because rename_patient_data() will only work on the dataframe created by get_patient_data() . But imagine you had another function called rename_df_columns() , which takes a dataframe and a dictionary mapping old to new column names. This is more flexible - you could use this on any dataframe, not just your patient data one. You could use it in other projects, and other teams could use it in their projects! That's loose coupling. Of course in the real world, sometimes things do have to be tightly coupled. That's OK! Just decouple where you can. Organise your code In an analytical pipeline, you\u2019ll typically have an entry point file to run the pipeline, e.g., create_publication.py. Store all your functions in separate files, and organise similar functions into in the same folders/files/classes. We find that four folders will cover most bases: data_in data_processing data_out utils There's no need to start from scratch either - we have a Package Template you can use that follows this structure. Improve your variable and function names Variable names should indicate what the variable is. Function names should indicate what the function does. A good rule of thumb is to start variable names with nouns and function names with verbs. Not so good Better df1 df_gp_code df2 df_patient_data df3 df_patient_data_with_gp_code value prescription_value import() import_csv_to_df() month_list() get_month_list() Look up the general naming conventions within the language you're using. For example in python, it's conventional to use: snake_case rather than camelCase for functions and variables Capitalised class names, e.g. class DatabaseConnection() ALL_CAPS for global variables and constants Keep variables in their own scope Define variables within the scope that they will be used (e.g., in the relevant function, class, or module). If there are global variables needed throughout the code, group them into a config/params dictionary so you know where they are defined. Minimise nesting Code with multiple nested levels is hard to read. Try using guard clauses in functions, which will return early if a given condition is met. For example the below function: def can_drink_alcohol ( age , country ): if age is not None : if age < 18 : can_drink = False elif age < 21 : if country == \"United States\" : can_drink = False elif country == \"United Kingdom\" : can_drink = True else : can_drink = True else : can_drink = False return can_drink ...could become... def can_drink_alcohol ( age , country ): if age == None : return False if age < 18 : return False if age < 21 and country == \"United States\" : return False return True Extract complex expressions into variables If you have a complex expression (perhaps a complex join clause), extract it into a variable with a descriptive name explaining what it does. Use a linter A linter is a tool that will scan your code for errors and give you formatting suggestions. Linters give you a quick and easy way to ensure consistent formatting across your project, and some can even reformat all your files for you automatically! If you're using an editor like VS Code you'll be able to install linters as extensions, but you can also install and run them via the command line. Popular linters include black and pylint for Python and lintr for R. Code smells A \"code smell\" is an indication that something is \"off\" in your code. It's a surface indication of what may be a deeper problem, especially if not resolved. If you don't fix issues with your code early, then when you add more code to your project you'll be building on a poor foundation. A bad code smell can soon become rotten! Here are a few examples of code smells, and which of the refactoring rules you can employ to fix them: Seeing the same sorts of code / patterns multiple times (wrap into functions) Long functions with multiple arguments (break into multiple functions) Very long python files (break into multiple files) Constantly passing a lot of stuff between functions (might mean you need a class) Difficult to know where the code \"starts\" (you need a clear \"main\" file - entrypoint) I've got no idea what this function does (add doc strings) I've got no idea what this variable holds (improve naming conventions) The number of if statements in this function is giving me a headache (reduce nesting) Your turn Thinking about your pipelines, did any of the above rules jump out to you as something you could implement?

For example, say you have two functions. get_patient_data() gets patient data from a database and stores it in a dataframe. rename_patient_data() takes that dataframe, renames some columns, and returns it. These functions are tightly coupled because rename_patient_data() will only work on the dataframe created by get_patient_data() . But imagine you had another function called rename_df_columns() , which takes a dataframe and a dictionary mapping old to new column names. This is more flexible - you could use this on any dataframe, not just your patient data one. You could use it in other projects, and other teams could use it in their projects! That's loose coupling.

Typically this comes at the point of diminishing returns when the effort spent outweighs the benefits gained. Knowing when to stop coding can help your code be well-engineered , which can be achieved using the principles of YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need This) and KISS (Keep It Simple & Straightforward), as well as following Agile practices as per the NHS Digital Service Standards . To ensure your code is well-engineered, ask yourself these questions: Does your code solve your problem? How likely is this thing going to change? What is most important during delivery? Is this feature key or nice to have? Are you introducing new features into the system in a controlled manner, following NHS Digital Service Standards? What is the reason behind your approach - are there simpler alternatives? Is your code, function or pipeline trying to be a Jack of All Trades - can it become less generic and more focused? How simple is it to maintain and build on your code or pipeline? Refactoring is an integral part of the development process and should be done correctly. Work with your team to understand when to refactor your code and what standard you work towards; these standards could be linked to the Level of RAP . Finally, it is important to know when to stop writing tests so your code is well-tested . Well-tested code is well-engineered, so use similar principles and strategies. Help ensure that your code is well-tested with the following questions: What could a user do wrong? How could an input be wrong? How will your pipeline respond to these scenarios? Do we have tests to cover these scenarios? Why should you care about when you should stop coding? When developing code of any type, it is important to know when to stop, especially when constrained by time or skill demands. When do you stop \"improving\" your code to handle more features, be more optimised, fit coding standards better, or have greater testing coverage? Deciding when to stop is a balancing act; if you stop coding too early and release code that is not \"complete\", it might be: Hard for another coder (or your forgetful, future self) to understand and maintain. Inefficient and consume unnecessary resources. Hard to add new features to. Understanding when to stop coding can also be important when considering which level of RAP your team is working towards, especially when working towards Silver and Gold levels of RAP. Knowing which level of RAP your team is working towards will shape your approach to the following concepts and questions. The Point of Diminishing Returns Essentially, the answer comes down to reaching the point of diminishing returns. The point at which the effort you put into your project outweighs the benefits you get from that effort. One of these benefits might be the time saved vs the effort of time spent. The webcomic xkcd has a relevant comic for this case, showing how much time you can work on saving time in the future for it to be worth it. For example, suppose you wanted to make your inefficient monthly report pipeline more efficient, saving 5 minutes in run time. In that case, for it to be worth it, you need to spend less than 5 hours working on the improvements (assuming you will see those benefits over five years). However, suppose your pipeline is already efficient, and you will only save 5 seconds on your total run time. Then, you will only have 5 minutes to implement improvements for it to be worth it - a tough ask! Note The above comic and examples are a simplistic look, best for back-of-the-envelop guestimations. It doesn't account for commonly unappreciated factors such as time saved by not doing rework caused by flawed processes, checking bad outputs, or making future development easier to complete. However, time savings might not be the only benefit you might get from spending more effort on a project; instead, you could aim for the following: Compute savings - If your pipeline runs on cloud compute, this could charge based on the compute used. Making a more compute-efficient pipeline could save time and money. If you're using shared compute, like a SQL server, then more efficient code might impact your colleagues less when you're running some very heavy job. Data savings - Some data storage services charge for the amount of data stored or accessed. Reducing the data your pipeline needs could save money. Reading/writing data to/from storage unnecessarily can also be a source of compute inefficiency. Risk reductions - This is partly discussed later , but the project you are working on will have a level of acceptable risk, with some projects requiring more effort for a lower level of risk. Over-Engineering Over-engineering can be when your design or code makes things more complex; instead of simplifying things. Sometimes, when writing code, we add in unnecessary elements that don't contribute to the problem we are trying to solve, for example: Adding code for a future problem, just in case Adding features that aren't part of the requirements Overcomplicating your code instead of relying on a simplified approach without improving efficiency or code quality. Altogether, this comes back to the point of diminishing returns. Does the benefit of the changes meet or exceed the cost of implementation? Avoid adding code for a future problem, just in case The principle of YAGNI is beneficial here. YAGNI stands for \"You Ain't Gonna Need It.\" You should only add functionality once it is deemed necessary; adding it before it is required will rarely turn out as a net positive. Requirements can regularly change or be dropped, and your time working on features can be wasted, making deadlines harder to meet. For example, if you needed to develop a function that could reverse a word, develop a function that did just that. It might be tempting to develop a function that could rearrange any string into any order, just in case you needed that functionality in the future. However, this goes against YAGNI; you don't need that functionality yet. In addition, if you consider how you would add in this functionality when it is needed, we realise we can create a new function to rearrange strings and alter our string reversal function to use the rearrange strings function. We wouldn't have benefited from adding the additional functionality in advance. Another dimension to this problem is worrying too much about how easy it is to extend your code. Try to understand which features of your project you will be extending and building on. If you are using Agile Sprints (discussed in the next section) as your development cycle, review and refine your backlog to build an understanding of what features are coming in the future and what their implementation demands will be. It is good to have extendable code as it helps avoid problems in the future when refactoring and adding new features. However, if you and your team are confident that a feature will stay the same, then you don't need to make that part of your code very extendable. To help keep to the YAGNI principle, keep asking yourself these questions about your code: Does your code solve your problem? How likely is this thing going to change? Avoid adding features that aren't part of the requirements Firstly, it is important to have clear requirements or objectives for your project. It would help if you had a goal to describe what features are key to include, and therefore, you may not get as distracted implementing something unnecessary or overly complex. Typically, it is the responsibility of the Lead Analyst or Product Owner in your team to provide these details, so discuss the requirements and objectives with them to ensure they are clearly defined, and deadlines are set. Alternatively, you can talk with your team to ensure that the right balance is found. The NHS Digital Service Manual Service Standard has two standards that are applicable here, use agile ways of working and iterate and improve frequently . Agile ways of working can reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing by encouraging publishing your code and getting in front of users, stakeholders, and peers as soon as possible. Publishing code: facilitates feedback from these groups, helping improve our code quality and select requirements more effectively allows the reuse of code, letting you focus only on your team's requirements ultimately saves time by reusing snippets of code that will help make your code more efficient Iteratively implementing your code is helpful when building your pipeline. Choosing one or a number of features, fixes or tests to work on in a Sprint (usually one to two weeks) helps to stably build your pipeline, keep track of what you are building, take into account any requirements changes and squish any bugs as they arise. Your team can constantly review the code and requirements and build on the pipeline. Avoid issues with this aspect of over-engineering by asking yourself this question about your code and development process: What is most important during delivery? Is this feature key or nice to have? Are you introducing new features into the system in a controlled manner, following NHS Digital Service Standards? Avoid overcomplicating your code The principle of KISS is beneficial here. KISS can stand for \"Keep It Simple & Straightforward\" . The core thinking of this principle is that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. When developing solutions, consider whether it is a practically simple or unnecessarily complicated way of solving the issue. Code can quickly become overly complex. This complexity commonly occurs when a feature is reused in multiple situations, pushing it to be more flexible and generic. However, making code too generic can cause it to become: Overly complex in its functionality. Unclear what the code is doing. Bad at doing its job(s), \"Jack of All Trades, Master of None\". If you need to make your code complex, mitigate future problems by documenting it well, using docstrings or comments or creating a document explaining how to use the code and its purpose. The \"Straightforward\" part of \"KISS\" refers to how things break and the sophistication available to fix them. Your code should be straightforward to read, understand, and diagnose what is broken with it. Using advanced methods might be tempting, but it will offer a significant hurdle to someone else in the future with less advanced knowledge when they need to repair or improve your solution. If a complicated or advanced method is required, ensure clear documentation is provided to help others (and your future self) get up to speed quicker. Note KISS originally meant \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\" , with the Aerospace Engineer Kelly Johnson of the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works being attributed with coining the phrase. The Skunk Works developed experimental and advanced aeroplanes, including the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber. While sounding like a churlish addition, the \"Stupid\" part of \"KISS\" means the same as \"Straightforward\". Kelly Johnson would task Design Engineers to design their aeroplanes to be repairable under combat conditions in the field by an average mechanic with a standard set of tools. With analytical pipelines, this concept can apply to both the code design you use in your functions and your overall approach to your pipeline. Your pipeline overall should be kept simple, which helps with transparency, allowing someone unfamiliar with the process to understand what your pipeline does. In addition, if you are looking to release your pipeline as a package, make sure that you don't try to make the All-Purpose NHS Data Super-Pipeline Package , but instead a specific pipeline with a specific range of outputs. Focusing on your pipeline's results can help implement the KISS principle. To help keep to this principle, keep asking yourself these questions about your code and pipeline: What is the reason behind your approach - are there simpler alternatives? Is your code, function or pipeline trying to be a Jack of All Trades - can it become less generic and more focused? How straightforward is it to maintain and build on your code or pipeline? Under-Engineering While talking about Over-Engineering, it is also essential to also consider Under-Engineering . Under-Engineering is where not enough effort has been put into the design and build of the code , which can be due to a range of factors. Typically under-engineering occurs in inexperienced or under-resourced development teams. Once they get something working, they stop working on it and either do not realise there are better ways of doing it or are not allowed the time to review the code. This under-engineered code is frequently buggy, overcomplicated, or overly verbose that is hard to maintain and test. Under-engineered can also be referred to as a type of technical debt. Technical debt, like financial debt, allows you to do something sooner than you might otherwise, but until you pay that debt back, it will accumulate interest with time. Your under-engineered code might be ready sooner, but your familiarity with the code will decrease with time. Your under-engineered code will be much more challenging to maintain than well-engineered code. Over-engineering vs Under-engineering Your focus on avoiding over-engineering and under-engineering will change depending on the project. Some will demand more focus on avoiding under-engineering, typically where safety is critical to service. Avoiding under-engineering here might mean building a higher safety tolerance level to ensure the service doesn't fail. An example of this could be a publication used to make a critical decision, like which patients should receive an important treatment or vaccine. Another reason to focus on avoiding under-engineering can be when you know some code will be regularly used, changed, and maintained. A publication published weekly or a pipeline that produces data used in multiple other services might warrant a focus on avoiding under-engineering. Other projects will demand a focus on avoiding over-engineering or a willingness to accept under-engineering. These usually are projects with a high demand for delivery as soon as possible; a \"Just Get It Done\" attitude. Tech Startups typically work under \"Ship or Sink\" environments and will adopt the \"Just Get It Done\" attitude and care less about avoiding under-engineering. In the world of analytical pipelines, a yearly publication could be under-engineered due to the principle of diminishing returns discussed earlier in this guide. It is run so infrequently time spent on non-critical improvements would be far greater than the time saved. Are you refactoring your code when needed? Refactoring your code is an integral part of the code development process. It is development time when you can improve your code and ensure it is well-engineered. However, it is important to understand when you should be refactoring: After you have got your code working initially, you should go back and refactor your code. If you are developing using Test Driven Development after completing the Green process step, you will refactor your code. If you are developing a thin-slice pipeline after you have replicated the target output and you start iteratively improving the code. After a code review and you have received feedback. When you are about to add a new feature to the code, go back over the relevant code and see if you can make adding functionality easier. With all three of these cases, you should be going into the refactoring with specific objectives of what type of technical debt you will reduce. Feel free to beat a retreat when you cannot follow conventions and standards, but make sure to document in the code why it is that way. To ensure that you are refactoring the right way: The code should become cleaner. If you are struggling to do this, either your refactoring objectives are too broad and need to be more specific and achievable, or the code is too sloppy and might need a complete rewrite to make it maintainable. You shouldn't create new functionality during refactoring All existing tests must pass after refactoring. If tests fail after refactoring, you either made an error during refactoring or the tests were too low level. Finally, your team will need to set an agreed standard towards which you are refactoring. These standards can depend on the instance, especially for analytical pipelines: There might be a methodology requirement that dictates a specific process for producing some output values. Your team has a very specific pipeline flow that everyone needs to follow, e.g. due to engineering limitations, tables must be joined at specific points. Refactoring and Levels of RAP The Silver Level of RAP contains several items that would be a result of refactoring a Baseline Level of RAP pipeline. The target level of RAP should naturally shape your objective when refactoring your code. For example, when refactoring your code, you might have the objective to review and strip out commonly used code snippets and replace them with functions that do the same thing, bringing you closer to the Silver Level of RAP. Does your code have the correct amount of testing? The answer to this question is very similar to over-engineering , as you are developing a test framework with the requirement to adequately cover and provide assurance for your code. It can suffer from the same pitfalls that your main functional code can. Over-tested code can end up with tests that duplicate the functionality of other tests or tests that test for practically impossible situations. On the other side of this under-tested code (due to an under-engineered test framework). Under-tested code means you cannot be assured of the quality of the outputs from the pipeline. Under-tested code might not cover all of the requirements of the pipeline; this typically happens when the requirements and objectives have been poorly thought out. See the section on over-engineering and requirements for advice on how to avoid this pitfall. Under-testing usually happens when developers focus too much on the \"Happy Path\" and less on the \"Unhappy Path\" . \"Happy Path\" testing is when you test for expected behaviours and what users are supposed to do. However, users are humans, and humans have the wonderful ability to do what they are not supposed to do! When your user does what they are not supposed to do and tries to break your system, either inadvertently or maliciously, it is called the unhappy path. In the case of analytical pipelines, the user is the person providing the inputs to the system, either by running it or the person that put together the input data (possibly incorrectly). To ensure the \"Unhappy Path\" is covered by tests, ask yourself and your team the following questions: What could a user do wrong? How could an input be wrong? How will your pipeline respond to these scenarios? Do we have tests to cover these scenarios? Testing your code is part of achieving the Silver Level of RAP . We have some existing guidance on Unit Testing that covers how to write tests (in python) and what those tests should be doing. Over-Testing vs Under-Testing Like the balance between over-engineering and under-engineering , there is a balance with tests your team will want to find to ensure that your code is well-tested. Your team might find it helpful to focus their testing efforts on critical pipeline parts. These critical parts will either be: Functions that are earlier on in the pipeline, with downstream parts of the process depending on the outputs; or, Functions that are repeatably used in multiple areas of the pipeline. You should prioritise these functions to ensure they are tested and will work as expected. Code Coverage and Test Coverage Code Coverage and Test Coverage are metrics that could be useful to you and your team when assessing the question, \"Does your code have the correct amount of testing?\". Code Coverage is a measure that shows the extent to which your pipeline code gets executed while testing the code, i.e. how much of your code is covered by the tests. When your test suite is run, it should execute different lines of code in your pipeline. If your code has an if-else statement, then only the part of the code that meets the condition set by the test will be executed. Ideally, your test cases should account for all of these situations and run with different settings to ensure that other code is run. This would then lead to full code coverage. \\[ \\text{Code Coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Lines of Code Executed By Tests}}{\\text{Total Lines of Code}}\\times100 \\] Test Coverage is a measure of how much of the expected testing has been covered during the testing of a pipeline. In other words, it is a measure of how much of the end-to-end integrated, empirical, functional, and other tests that are defined explicitly and implicitly in project specification that are implemented. For example, the project specification might require for your pipeline to output a table of a certain schema, then we would expect at least one test to check that this the case. Reviewing the requirements and calculating the number of tests required to prove that these requirements have been implemented gives you the Total Expected Test cases . You can then compare this with your current suite of test cases to check your Test Coverage : \\[ \\text{Test Coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Current Number of Implemented Test Cases}}{\\text{Total Number of Expected Test Cases}}\\times100 \\] These metrics are only approximate proxies for how well-tested your code is. It is possible to have high code and test coverage and still have gaps in your tests. Discuss your testing strategy with your team and, if limited in resources or time, where you want to focus your testing to provide the best confidence in your outputs.

Understanding when to stop coding can also be important when considering which level of RAP your team is working towards, especially when working towards Silver and Gold levels of RAP. Knowing which level of RAP your team is working towards will shape your approach to the following concepts and questions.","title":"Why should you care about when you should stop coding?"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#the-point-of-diminishing-returns","text":"Essentially, the answer comes down to reaching the point of diminishing returns. The point at which the effort you put into your project outweighs the benefits you get from that effort. One of these benefits might be the time saved vs the effort of time spent. The webcomic xkcd has a relevant comic for this case, showing how much time you can work on saving time in the future for it to be worth it. For example, suppose you wanted to make your inefficient monthly report pipeline more efficient, saving 5 minutes in run time. In that case, for it to be worth it, you need to spend less than 5 hours working on the improvements (assuming you will see those benefits over five years). However, suppose your pipeline is already efficient, and you will only save 5 seconds on your total run time. Then, you will only have 5 minutes to implement improvements for it to be worth it - a tough ask! Note The above comic and examples are a simplistic look, best for back-of-the-envelop guestimations. It doesn't account for commonly unappreciated factors such as time saved by not doing rework caused by flawed processes, checking bad outputs, or making future development easier to complete. However, time savings might not be the only benefit you might get from spending more effort on a project; instead, you could aim for the following: Compute savings - If your pipeline runs on cloud compute, this could charge based on the compute used. Making a more compute-efficient pipeline could save time and money. If you're using shared compute, like a SQL server, then more efficient code might impact your colleagues less when you're running some very heavy job. Data savings - Some data storage services charge for the amount of data stored or accessed. Reducing the data your pipeline needs could save money. Reading/writing data to/from storage unnecessarily can also be a source of compute inefficiency. Risk reductions - This is partly discussed later , but the project you are working on will have a level of acceptable risk, with some projects requiring more effort for a lower level of risk.","title":"The Point of Diminishing Returns"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#over-engineering","text":"Over-engineering can be when your design or code makes things more complex; instead of simplifying things. Sometimes, when writing code, we add in unnecessary elements that don't contribute to the problem we are trying to solve, for example: Adding code for a future problem, just in case Adding features that aren't part of the requirements Overcomplicating your code instead of relying on a simplified approach without improving efficiency or code quality. Altogether, this comes back to the point of diminishing returns. Does the benefit of the changes meet or exceed the cost of implementation?","title":"Over-Engineering"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#avoid-adding-code-for-a-future-problem-just-in-case","text":"The principle of YAGNI is beneficial here. YAGNI stands for \"You Ain't Gonna Need It.\" You should only add functionality once it is deemed necessary; adding it before it is required will rarely turn out as a net positive. Requirements can regularly change or be dropped, and your time working on features can be wasted, making deadlines harder to meet. For example, if you needed to develop a function that could reverse a word, develop a function that did just that. It might be tempting to develop a function that could rearrange any string into any order, just in case you needed that functionality in the future. However, this goes against YAGNI; you don't need that functionality yet. In addition, if you consider how you would add in this functionality when it is needed, we realise we can create a new function to rearrange strings and alter our string reversal function to use the rearrange strings function. We wouldn't have benefited from adding the additional functionality in advance. Another dimension to this problem is worrying too much about how easy it is to extend your code. Try to understand which features of your project you will be extending and building on. If you are using Agile Sprints (discussed in the next section) as your development cycle, review and refine your backlog to build an understanding of what features are coming in the future and what their implementation demands will be. It is good to have extendable code as it helps avoid problems in the future when refactoring and adding new features. However, if you and your team are confident that a feature will stay the same, then you don't need to make that part of your code very extendable. To help keep to the YAGNI principle, keep asking yourself these questions about your code: Does your code solve your problem? How likely is this thing going to change?","title":"Avoid adding code for a future problem, just in case"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#avoid-adding-features-that-arent-part-of-the-requirements","text":"Firstly, it is important to have clear requirements or objectives for your project. It would help if you had a goal to describe what features are key to include, and therefore, you may not get as distracted implementing something unnecessary or overly complex. Typically, it is the responsibility of the Lead Analyst or Product Owner in your team to provide these details, so discuss the requirements and objectives with them to ensure they are clearly defined, and deadlines are set. Alternatively, you can talk with your team to ensure that the right balance is found. The NHS Digital Service Manual Service Standard has two standards that are applicable here, use agile ways of working and iterate and improve frequently . Agile ways of working can reduce the risk of delivering the wrong thing by encouraging publishing your code and getting in front of users, stakeholders, and peers as soon as possible. Publishing code: facilitates feedback from these groups, helping improve our code quality and select requirements more effectively allows the reuse of code, letting you focus only on your team's requirements ultimately saves time by reusing snippets of code that will help make your code more efficient Iteratively implementing your code is helpful when building your pipeline. Choosing one or a number of features, fixes or tests to work on in a Sprint (usually one to two weeks) helps to stably build your pipeline, keep track of what you are building, take into account any requirements changes and squish any bugs as they arise. Your team can constantly review the code and requirements and build on the pipeline. Avoid issues with this aspect of over-engineering by asking yourself this question about your code and development process: What is most important during delivery? Is this feature key or nice to have? Are you introducing new features into the system in a controlled manner, following NHS Digital Service Standards?","title":"Avoid adding features that aren't part of the requirements"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#avoid-overcomplicating-your-code","text":"The principle of KISS is beneficial here. KISS can stand for \"Keep It Simple & Straightforward\" . The core thinking of this principle is that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. When developing solutions, consider whether it is a practically simple or unnecessarily complicated way of solving the issue. Code can quickly become overly complex. This complexity commonly occurs when a feature is reused in multiple situations, pushing it to be more flexible and generic. However, making code too generic can cause it to become: Overly complex in its functionality. Unclear what the code is doing. Bad at doing its job(s), \"Jack of All Trades, Master of None\". If you need to make your code complex, mitigate future problems by documenting it well, using docstrings or comments or creating a document explaining how to use the code and its purpose. The \"Straightforward\" part of \"KISS\" refers to how things break and the sophistication available to fix them. Your code should be straightforward to read, understand, and diagnose what is broken with it. Using advanced methods might be tempting, but it will offer a significant hurdle to someone else in the future with less advanced knowledge when they need to repair or improve your solution. If a complicated or advanced method is required, ensure clear documentation is provided to help others (and your future self) get up to speed quicker. Note KISS originally meant \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\" , with the Aerospace Engineer Kelly Johnson of the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works being attributed with coining the phrase. The Skunk Works developed experimental and advanced aeroplanes, including the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber. While sounding like a churlish addition, the \"Stupid\" part of \"KISS\" means the same as \"Straightforward\". Kelly Johnson would task Design Engineers to design their aeroplanes to be repairable under combat conditions in the field by an average mechanic with a standard set of tools. With analytical pipelines, this concept can apply to both the code design you use in your functions and your overall approach to your pipeline. Your pipeline overall should be kept simple, which helps with transparency, allowing someone unfamiliar with the process to understand what your pipeline does. In addition, if you are looking to release your pipeline as a package, make sure that you don't try to make the All-Purpose NHS Data Super-Pipeline Package , but instead a specific pipeline with a specific range of outputs. Focusing on your pipeline's results can help implement the KISS principle. To help keep to this principle, keep asking yourself these questions about your code and pipeline: What is the reason behind your approach - are there simpler alternatives? Is your code, function or pipeline trying to be a Jack of All Trades - can it become less generic and more focused? How straightforward is it to maintain and build on your code or pipeline?","title":"Avoid overcomplicating your code"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#under-engineering","text":"While talking about Over-Engineering, it is also essential to also consider Under-Engineering . Under-Engineering is where not enough effort has been put into the design and build of the code , which can be due to a range of factors. Typically under-engineering occurs in inexperienced or under-resourced development teams. Once they get something working, they stop working on it and either do not realise there are better ways of doing it or are not allowed the time to review the code. This under-engineered code is frequently buggy, overcomplicated, or overly verbose that is hard to maintain and test. Under-engineered can also be referred to as a type of technical debt. Technical debt, like financial debt, allows you to do something sooner than you might otherwise, but until you pay that debt back, it will accumulate interest with time. Your under-engineered code might be ready sooner, but your familiarity with the code will decrease with time. Your under-engineered code will be much more challenging to maintain than well-engineered code.","title":"Under-Engineering"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#over-engineering-vs-under-engineering","text":"Your focus on avoiding over-engineering and under-engineering will change depending on the project. Some will demand more focus on avoiding under-engineering, typically where safety is critical to service. Avoiding under-engineering here might mean building a higher safety tolerance level to ensure the service doesn't fail. An example of this could be a publication used to make a critical decision, like which patients should receive an important treatment or vaccine. Another reason to focus on avoiding under-engineering can be when you know some code will be regularly used, changed, and maintained. A publication published weekly or a pipeline that produces data used in multiple other services might warrant a focus on avoiding under-engineering. Other projects will demand a focus on avoiding over-engineering or a willingness to accept under-engineering. These usually are projects with a high demand for delivery as soon as possible; a \"Just Get It Done\" attitude. Tech Startups typically work under \"Ship or Sink\" environments and will adopt the \"Just Get It Done\" attitude and care less about avoiding under-engineering. In the world of analytical pipelines, a yearly publication could be under-engineered due to the principle of diminishing returns discussed earlier in this guide. It is run so infrequently time spent on non-critical improvements would be far greater than the time saved.","title":"Over-engineering vs Under-engineering"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#are-you-refactoring-your-code-when-needed","text":"Refactoring your code is an integral part of the code development process. It is development time when you can improve your code and ensure it is well-engineered. However, it is important to understand when you should be refactoring: After you have got your code working initially, you should go back and refactor your code. If you are developing using Test Driven Development after completing the Green process step, you will refactor your code. If you are developing a thin-slice pipeline after you have replicated the target output and you start iteratively improving the code. After a code review and you have received feedback. When you are about to add a new feature to the code, go back over the relevant code and see if you can make adding functionality easier. With all three of these cases, you should be going into the refactoring with specific objectives of what type of technical debt you will reduce. Feel free to beat a retreat when you cannot follow conventions and standards, but make sure to document in the code why it is that way. To ensure that you are refactoring the right way: The code should become cleaner. If you are struggling to do this, either your refactoring objectives are too broad and need to be more specific and achievable, or the code is too sloppy and might need a complete rewrite to make it maintainable. You shouldn't create new functionality during refactoring All existing tests must pass after refactoring. If tests fail after refactoring, you either made an error during refactoring or the tests were too low level. Finally, your team will need to set an agreed standard towards which you are refactoring. These standards can depend on the instance, especially for analytical pipelines: There might be a methodology requirement that dictates a specific process for producing some output values. Your team has a very specific pipeline flow that everyone needs to follow, e.g. due to engineering limitations, tables must be joined at specific points.","title":"Are you refactoring your code when needed?"},{"location":"training_resources/coding_tips/when-to-stop-coding/#refactoring-and-levels-of-rap","text":"The Silver Level of RAP contains several items that would be a result of refactoring a Baseline Level of RAP pipeline.

It can suffer from the same pitfalls that your main functional code can. Over-tested code can end up with tests that duplicate the functionality of other tests or tests that test for practically impossible situations. On the other side of this under-tested code (due to an under-engineered test framework). Under-tested code means you cannot be assured of the quality of the outputs from the pipeline. Under-tested code might not cover all of the requirements of the pipeline; this typically happens when the requirements and objectives have been poorly thought out. See the section on over-engineering and requirements for advice on how to avoid this pitfall. Under-testing usually happens when developers focus too much on the \"Happy Path\" and less on the \"Unhappy Path\" . \"Happy Path\" testing is when you test for expected behaviours and what users are supposed to do. However, users are humans, and humans have the wonderful ability to do what they are not supposed to do! When your user does what they are not supposed to do and tries to break your system, either inadvertently or maliciously, it is called the unhappy path. In the case of analytical pipelines, the user is the person providing the inputs to the system, either by running it or the person that put together the input data (possibly incorrectly). To ensure the \"Unhappy Path\" is covered by tests, ask yourself and your team the following questions: What could a user do wrong? How could an input be wrong? How will your pipeline respond to these scenarios? Do we have tests to cover these scenarios? Testing your code is part of achieving the Silver Level of RAP .

Code Coverage is a measure that shows the extent to which your pipeline code gets executed while testing the code, i.e. how much of your code is covered by the tests. When your test suite is run, it should execute different lines of code in your pipeline. If your code has an if-else statement, then only the part of the code that meets the condition set by the test will be executed. Ideally, your test cases should account for all of these situations and run with different settings to ensure that other code is run. This would then lead to full code coverage. \\[ \\text{Code Coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Lines of Code Executed By Tests}}{\\text{Total Lines of Code}}\\times100 \\] Test Coverage is a measure of how much of the expected testing has been covered during the testing of a pipeline. In other words, it is a measure of how much of the end-to-end integrated, empirical, functional, and other tests that are defined explicitly and implicitly in project specification that are implemented. For example, the project specification might require for your pipeline to output a table of a certain schema, then we would expect at least one test to check that this the case. Reviewing the requirements and calculating the number of tests required to prove that these requirements have been implemented gives you the Total Expected Test cases . You can then compare this with your current suite of test cases to check your Test Coverage : \\[ \\text{Test Coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Current Number of Implemented Test Cases}}{\\text{Total Number of Expected Test Cases}}\\times100 \\] These metrics are only approximate proxies for how well-tested your code is.

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Git\u2019s behavior and trigger actions at key points in development. Since scripts are infinitely customizable, you can use Git hooks to automate or optimize virtually any aspect of your development workflow. Some example hook scripts include: pre-commit: Check commit messages for spelling errors. pre-receive: Enforce project coding standards. post-receive: Push code to production. post-release: Publish a packaged repository to PyPI. Why use Git hooks? Git hooks can greatly increase your productivity as a developer. They can be written in any language and their biggest advantage is workflow automation. For example, you can use a Git hook to check that commit messages follow a standard and prevent the commit from executing. However, if you still want to commit, you can simply skip or override it. When you add a hook to your local Git repository, it will not impose any policy outside of it as the hooks are stored in the .git/hooks directory which is ignored by Git by default. The most important use of Git hooks is secret detection. Git hooks allow developers to easily and automatically detect any vulnerable secrets in their source code. The govcookiecutter template repository already has secret detection integrated in it.

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing any changes on a project's code, files or directories over time. This allows you to observe a detailed history of the changes made and enables your team members to collaborate on the same project. The Pro Git book , written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, has a more detailed introduction to Version Control and the different types that exist. The Duck book also has some excellent guidance on why you should use version control and how to use Git. What is Git? Git is a free, light-weight and open-source version control system; it is considered the standard version control system. Other version control systems exist, however, git's feature set has made it the dominant version control system. While Git has a steep initial learning curve, the payoff is huge and it is strongly recommend you take the time to learn it. In Git, each user has the entire repository (project's working directory) on their computer (offline), hence, they can work separately offline until they opt to push their updated version of the code to the remote (online) central repository. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on an online Version Control System, such as GitHub and GitLab (also BitBucket ). What is the difference between Git, GitLab, and GitHub? Git GitHub GitLab Git is the software, locally installed on your computer and manages code and file history. Git was released in 2005 and maintained by Linux. Git focuses on version control and code sharing and has no user management ability. Get started with Git with our Git Quick Start Guide GitHub is a cloud-based remote repository storage service accessible online . GitHub was released in 2008 and is maintained by Microsoft. GitHub focuses on centralising source code hosting and provides user management features. GitHub is highly integrated with Visual Studio Code, which is also maintained by Microsoft. NHS Digital has a GitHub \"Organisation\" which can host both public code repositories and private ones only visible to NHS Digital colleagues. This website is hosted out of the NHS Digital GitHub organisation - see the repo here . GitHub also provides some additional features, such as GitHub Pages , which is used to host static websites. This website is hosted in this exact way. Get started with GitHub by checking out our GitHub Quick Start Guide GitLab, like GitHub, is a remote repository storage service. It is accessible online . It was released in 2014 and is maintained by GitLab Inc, which is considered the first partly-Ukrainian unicorn. GitLab hosts Git repositories, focusing on centralising source code hosting. It provides user management features. Both GitHub and GitLab function in very similar ways with some differences in terminology , e.g. Merge Requests vs Pull Requests. NHS England has a number of internally hosted instances of GitLab. These can only be accessed by members of the instance. Get started with GitLab by checking out our GitLab Quick Start Guide Read more about Git You can read more about Git in the previously mentioned Pro Git book, including a short history of Git and what is Git in more detail than explained here. How do I use Git? You can start using Git on your machine with our Git Quick Start Guide . However, there are two main ways of interacting with Git, using the Command Line and using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Using the Command Line Using a GUI What is the Command Line? Aka the Terminal, the Command Prompt, the Shell The Command Line acts like a mediator - it takes text input (a command) and returns an output (a process, a result, an action) that depends on the command input's process. Command line terminals can be used to input commands such as listing directories, moving folders and files, version control (Git) and creating isolated environments (conda, venv etc). Using the Command Line is the recommended method of interacting with Git . It is the only method that you can use to run all Git commands. There are a number of command line terminals that are available for you to use, depending on what Operating System (OS) you are using: Windows MacOS Linux Git Bash is a recommended method of interacting with Git in Windows. Git Bash comes packaged with Git for Windows and provides a Bash emulation used to run Git from the command line. This provides commonality of commands with other OS's. Alternatively, Powershell is a powerful terminal built into Windows by default. Once installed, using Git is exactly the same as in Git Bash. However, other commands (like creating a new folder or viewing a folder's contents) might differ. In these guides, any differences in commands between Powershell and Git Bash will be highlighted. It is also possible to set up other terminals, like Anaconda Prompt and the legacy CMD prompts to work with Git. Terminal is the built-in command line terminal for MacOS. It uses an extended variant of Bash called Zsh , which adds some new features and support for plugins and themes. It still runs on the same commands as Bash, so it has many of the same features and commands. Terminal is the built-in command line terminal for Linux. It uses Bash on most distributions of Linux. It is relatively straightforward to customise the terminal in Linux, for example, setting it up to use Zsh with Oh My ZSH GUIs make it easier to use Git by presenting Git outputs in a more user-friendly state and removing the need to remember the exact commands needed. They are great for getting simple tasks done. Git comes with built-in GUI tools for committing ( git-gui ) and browsing ( gitk ), but there are several also third-party tools, like GitHub Desktop , and integrations with IDEs, like Visual Studio Code . However, GUIs are commonly limited in capabilities, usually only implementing a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. Therefore, it is recommended that you learn to use the command line first and as your primary means of working with Git. Then, after you feel more confident and are using it day-to-day, start exploring and adopting GUIs to make your life easier. Common Git Commands Below is a list of common commands for reference. We only list basic commands here. This is just to flag to you that these commands exist. You can google for more detail on any of them. git init Create a new Git repo locally. The init command is short for \"initialise\"; it's the command that will do all of the initial setup of a repository. The directory needs to actually exist before we can create a new repository with Git. git clone <url> Clone an existing Git Repository Happens only once when you need to create a local copy of a GitLab repository. git status Check whether any files have changed in a repository Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. See which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. The status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. git add Add files to the staging area git add <file> will add the specified file to the staging area, ready for commit. git add . will add all modified files to the staging area, ready for commit. git commit -m \"<message>\" Commit staged files with a message Committing changes in this way captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as \u201csafe\u201d versions of a project. git pull Update your current branch with the online/remote branch info Pulls the latest changes from the repository and only affects the current active branch you\u2019re in. git push Update the online/remote branch with commits from your current branch Pushes the latest changes to the repository and only affects the current active branch you're in. git fetch Downloads the online/remote repository information, including commits, files, and branches Unlike the more aggressive git pull , your local development work is unchanged. However, your local repository is aware of any changes that can be later integrated into your local work. git fetch is a great way to safely check what everybody else has been working on in the shared repository. git log Check the history of commits Press Q to exit the log. git diff Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory Press Q to exit the diff log. echo '<pattern>' >> .gitignore Adds a pattern to the end of .gitignore file This file specifies untracked files that git should ignore, such as the sensitive information related to security or the data itself. Files already tracked by git are not affected. See the section on what should you be version controlling for more details. git checkout Check out a branch. git checkout <your branch name> will checkout an existing branch git checkout -b <your branch name> will checkout a new branch git branch -a Display a list of all branches in the repository git branch -D <your branch name> Delete a local branch. Does not delete the remote branch git push origin -d <your branch name> Delete a remote branch Does not delete the local branch. Git Cheat-Sheets Keep a list of everyday Git Commands by bookmarking this cheat sheet: Git Commands Cheat-Sheet Info GitLab has a guide covering various cases on undoing any changes: undo possibilities in Git . What should I be version controlling? While most guides on Git will talk about tracking code files (i.e. .py , .sql , etc.) with Git, nearly any type of file on your computer can be tracked. However, there are some files that it is strongly recommended you do not version control using Git for a number of reasons: Large data files, directories, and databases; e.g. data-files/ , data/ , .dbs : Git struggles to store large files, and remote repositories normally have a hard limit on file sizes. Lookup or test data files of a reasonable size would probably be fine to include. These files might also contain Personal Identifiable Data (PID) which must not be added to the commit history. Configuration files and directories; e.g. .config , .vscode/ : Configuration files are typically custom to the individual, storing the configurations and preference setting for your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Including these files might cause confusion or \"It works on my machine\" situations. Environment and credentials files; e.g. .env , .credentials : These files might contain credentials, PATs, API keys, or other environment variables that are sensitive and should not be shared. Note: you should NEVER put credentials directly into your code. They should always be stored in a .env file or equivalent which are not committed to the Git repository GitHub and GitLab also allow you to store \"secrets\" for repos which can be used by collaborators but cannot be seen, copied or accessed directly. Run time files (e.g. logs); e.g. .logs : Log files that are generated by your code are very useful for providing infomation on what was happening when your code was running. They are very useful in debugging. However, these files are usually individual to the system and can get very big. Danger Once a file or directory is committed, a record of it and its contents will persist in the commit history. Simply deleting the file or directory at a later date will still leave a trace in the commit history. It is possible to scrub the Git history of any record of this file; however, this is risky in of itself and should be completed with great care. Prevention is much preferable to the cure. Even after scrubbing the Git history, consider any secret information that has been committed to a repository as potentially exposed. Carry out mitigation activities, like revoking and reissuing access keys and reporting PID leaks. gitignore .gitignore is a text file that contains file extensions and directories' paths that we wish Git to ignore. This will ensure that the files and directories that match those specified in the .gitignore file and avoiding the dangerous situations detailed above. For example, if we have created a repository that should never contain data, either held in a data directory or in CSV and XLSX Excel files elsewhere. We can create a .gitignore file and include in it the following: .gitignore data/ *.csv *.xlsx GitHub has a .gitignore template for python available for analysts and developers to use for their own projects. Some common patterns and formats for Git-Ignore files include: Blank Line A blank line doesn\u2019t refer to any file name, so we can use it to separate two file names for ease of reading. # A line beginning with the # symbol refers to a comment. However, if # is used as a pattern, then use backslash so that it is not misunderstood as a comment, \\# / Used as a directory separator, i.e. to include directories, for example, webdev/ . *.extension_name Used to match an extension name. For example, *.txt and *.log can be used to match ALL the files that have .txt and .log as their extension, respectively. **/any_name Used to match any file or directory with the name any_name. any_name/** Used to match anything that is inside the directory of the name any_name. For example, webdev/** matches all the files inside the webdev directory. !include_file.extension_name Used to create a negating pattern to exclude a file from a different pattern. In this example, all files with .extension_name are excluded, except include_file.extension_name . This does not work if trying to negate something in an already ignored directory. For example, !example_directory/example_file.md would not negate example_directory/ and example_file.md would still be ignored. Tracking Binary Format Files Git is primarily designed to work with text file formats as it can easily track changes to and within the file. If you are tracking files stored in binary format (e.g. Microsoft Files and other proprietary file formats, media, compressed files, etc.), Git will only be able to track that a change has happened to the file, but not the exact changes made. It is usually advised not to track binary files unless there is a good reason to. The RAP Community of Practice repository stores picture files to include in our documentation. Your repository might include a compressed directory containing an example output file your pipeline might produce. Finally, some proprietary file formats (e.g. Microsoft Office Files) have equivalent (possibly less feature-rich) text-based open file formats. Consider converting to these file formats to allow more detailed version control tracking (and allow more users to access those files). What next? Now you have been introduced to Git, make sure you are set up to use it with our Git , GitHub , and GitLab quick start guides. Once you are set up, check out our guide on using git collaboratively with your team and start incorporating it into your work.

There is a website which scans github for NHS github repositories and displays them by topic - making it easier to find useful code Why should we care? Applying topics for your repos will make it much easier to for you and others to find and reuse useful bits of code Using a common ontology will make the topics more useful - we will all be speaking the same language Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note None! Anyone can do this -though you need to have published some code on github already A key aim of RAP is to not only automate our pipelines, but to re-use useful code in other work . This relies on us publishing the code as publicly as possible, and then making it easy to find these useful bits of code. Topics in github can help with this, however we will get the most benefit from topics by using a common topic vocabulary to describe our GitHub code repos. The topic ontology described in this guide will ensure our code can be searched by: language and tech used what methods were used whether or not the code is recent or old (and if it still updated) what kinds of data the code was used with and where it came from The Differences between 'topics' and 'tags' In GitHub, tags and topics are different: Topics are labels applied to whole repos which describe them, like keywords. Each repo can up to twenty, and github is good at searching and sorting results by topics. Tags are labels applied to specific commits within a git repo, and it's how releases are made, e.g. v0.1.0 might be a tag applied to a specific commit locking in that this commit is Version 0.1.0. Topics Our aim with topics is to allow people to find code which might be useful to them, so they can reuse it. With this in mind, they usually want to know what kind of data the code was used on, in which language, if it was using the compatible datastructures (e.g. pandas, or pyspark) and how recently it was made / updated (people are less trustworth of ancient, dead code). When applying topics to your code: we suggest starting with the priority 1 categories below, e.g. Domain Area and Technique, first, as these are people tend to be most concerned with stick to the topics suggested below - this will ensure we get the most benefit out of them.

Branches allow you to create a parallel version of the repository and safely work on a new feature isolated from the rest of the repository. Your default branch is called the main branch and should remain stable and protected with completed, reviewed changes being merged in from feature branches. You can change to an existing branch with git checkout other-branch-name New branches can be created with git checkout --branch new-branch-name command and then published with git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name . Branches can be deleted locally with git branch --delete branch-name and remotely with git push origin --delete branch-name . You can merge changes from a different branch into your current branch with git merge source-branch-name Pull Requests allows you to assign reviewers to check your changes before you make a merge via GitHub. Merge Requests are GitLabs implementation of this. Sometimes Git needs help resolving conflicting changes when making a merge. It will clearly tell you where the conflicts are in the code so you can go through them and choose what to keep. Why should I care? The benefits of using branches are: It allows multiple changes to be worked on in parallel and conflicting changes to be resolved. It allows a clean, stable version of code to be maintained on your main branch. It encourages peer review of code. Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note Introduction to Git Necessary It is important to get an understanding of Git before starting to use it to collaborate Introduction to Collaborating When working with others (or even just yourself), it is good to divide and conquer the project, breaking it down into more manageable chunks of different features. Some of those features might be nice and discrete, with minimal interaction; however, some might be more entwined and blurred together. This is where collaborating on a project can sometimes get messy. Changes can be tangled together, and hard work might be overwritten accidentally and lost. In addition, changes will take a differing amount of time to implement, meaning some might be done, while some might still be messy work in progress. Git allows you to create branches and separate out those changes. Branches can be thought of as different parallel versions of the repository, with changes being made separately from each other. Meanwhile, a stable main branch of the code is kept clean from incomplete changes. Any new changes are first made to the branches. Once the changes have been made, a pull request can be created for them to be reviewed and approved before being merged safely into the main branch, with any overlapping changes being highlighted as merge conflicts to be resolved. This model of using branches with a shared repository is called the Shared Repository Model . Branches Working with branches is straightforward and powerful. There are four core operations you can do to a branch; change , create , delete , and merge . Changing your branch !!! \"Viewing your current branches\" You can view your current branches with the command `git branch`; this will display a list of branches local to your environment. Add the `-r` command to see remote branches only or `-a` to see both local and remote branches. You can change your branch with the git checkout command: git checkout other-branch-name If the branch doesn't yet exist locally to your system and only on the remote repository, then it will be downloaded and checked out. Local and Remote Branches When you are working with a repository with a remote version stored online, there are two versions of it, the local version and the remote version. These won't automatically be kept in sync; we have to tell Git when to push local changes to the remote and pull remote changes to the local. This applies for branches as well, and we have to manually tell Git when to send or receive and then apply updates. In fact, it is very common to have whole branches that are only local to your systems (usually, when you first create them, then you'll want to publish them to have a backup) and branches that are only remote to your systems (usually branches created by others that you don't need to use). Try it out! Have a go at changing branches in our working with branches walkthrough . Creating a Branch You can create a branch with the git branch command: git branch new-branch-name However, this does not automatically checkout the command and put you on this new branch. Any new commits will be applied to the old branch. Therefore, it is better to use the git checkout command with the --branch flag to tell it first to create the branch and THEN change it. git checkout --branch new-branch-name #(1)! This command actually does two things. It creates a new branch: git branch new-branch-name Then it checks it out: git checkout new-branch-name Typically, we will create new branches from whichever branch we are currently on. However, there are times when you might want to specify the source branch from which you are creating the new branch. To do this, simply specify the source branch after the new branch name: git checkout --branch new-branch-name source-branch-name #(1)! Again, this command actually does two things. It creates a new branch: git branch new-branch-name Then it checks it out: git checkout new-branch-name Try it out! Have a go at creating a branch in our working with branches walkthrough . Branch Naming Schemes It is good to have an agreed scheme in your team and your repositories when naming branches. This will allow you to communicate important aspects of the branch. We advise something like <branch type>/<project id>-<initials>-<ticket number>-<brief description> , but you can use, add, and drop different parts of this where it suits you. For example, this guide could be added to this repository under the branch feature/DS_218-JW-NV-1476-Update-the-Using-Git-Collaboratively-Guide with: feature/ , the branch type DS_218 , the internal project id for RAP JW , the branch author's initials NV-1476 , the JIRA ticket number Update-the-Using-Git-Collaboratively-Guide , a short description of the branch. There are a number of branch types a repository might have: feature/ - for adding new features release/ - for preparing or preserving a batch of changes for delivery hotfix/ - for emergency fixes to your main branch (if it is protected ) Publishing a branch If you have created a branch locally on your system, then you will need to publish it to the remote repository. This can be done using the git push with the --set-upstream flag ( -u for short) and specifying the remote alias, which is almost always origin : Why do we write origin ? origin is the default alias we give to the remote repository we clone from. This alias can be changed and can be checked using the git remote command to show the alias. Use git remote -v to also see the URLs associated with the remote alias. There will always be two, the fetch (download) and push (upload). Note that these two URLs will often be the same. git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name This only needs to be done once for a new branch. After that, Git will know which remote branch to work with. Remote Branches If the new branch was created remotely, e.g. on GitHub or GitLab, and then checked out to the local environment, then it does not need to be published. Git will already know which remote branch to track. Deleting your branch When deleting our branches, we must remember that there are two copies of a branch, one local and one remote (assuming that the branch has been previously checked out to your system). Therefore there are two separate commands for deleting the branch locally and remotely. Delete the local version of the branch git branch --delete branch-name Delete the remote version of the branch git push origin --delete branch-name Info While this deletes the versions of the branch that you can reach, collaborators that have also checked out that branch will still have a copy of that branch, communicate with them that you have deleted the remote for the branch so that they know to prune their repository. Try it out! Have a go at deleting your branch in our working with branches walkthrough . Pruning your local repository As development on your repository goes on, branches will be deleted remotely but might still exist on your local system. Therefore it is good to periodically prune any local branches that no longer have a counterpart on the remote. This can be done with a git fetch with the --prune flag: git fetch --prune Fetch dry run If you want to check what will happen when you run the git fetch command (in this example, what branches will be pruned), then add the --dry-run --verbose to get an output of what would be done without making changes. Merging your branch As you complete work on your feature branches, you will want to move those changes back into the main branch, although hopefully after a review and resolving any conflicting changes . To move these changes in, we are going to use the git merge command. git merge source-branch-name Ensuring the branches are updated with changes Before we merge, it is important to ensure that both the local version's source branch (the one we are merging from) and target branch (the one we are merging to) are both up to date with changes from the remote repository. git checkout source-branch-name git pull git checkout target-branch-name git pull Try it out! Have a go at merging branches in our working with branches walkthrough . Updating your branch As you collaborate and work on multiple branches in your project\u2019s repository, you might want to ensure that your branch is updated with changes from other branches, usually the main branch. This allows us to prevent future conflicts or resolve current conflicts . Pull Requests A Pull request (PR) is how you announce to other collaborators that you've finished your changes, and you're ready to merge them - usually into the main branch of the repository. Then, either your collaborators or someone you assign will review your changes to ensure they are ready to be merged. The equivalent term for GitLab users is Merge Request (MR). On the Pull request page, there are four tabs: Conversation Commits Files changed Checks Conversation is the main pull request page. It contains the pull request's description, timeline, and comments the assignee or reviewer left. To merge a pull request, you have three options: Merge pull request: this will keep the entire commit history of the source branch and add it to the target branch. Creates a symbolic commit. Squash and merge: ticking this will merge the history of commits for the source branch into one commit. This can be useful when the pull request is not a major update, and you don't want your repository's history of commits to contain commits with messages such as \"fixed typo\" or \"replaced incorrectly placed image\". Creates a merged commit. Rebase and merge: add all source branch commits in front of the target branch's commits. Does not create a symbolic commit. The Commits tab displays a history of the pull request's commits. So, for example, if the reviewer decides that minor adjustments are required, and the assignee pushes these changes to Gitlab, then these commits will be captured in this tab. In the Files changed tab, can you see all the new changes in the pull request's source branch. You can also opt for a side-by-side comparison and see line-by-line how the master version and new branch version compare. You can also leave comments on any line of any file, which will also be recorded in the Conversation tab's timeline. Checks is part of the GitHub Actions functionality, which enhances your code review processes with apps and automated reviewing checks. This is inactive by default. If you are happy to merge the two branches, then select the type of pull request you wish to apply, and the pull request should be completed in a few seconds. Try it out! Have a go at raising a pull request and conducting a review with our pull request walkthrough . Merge Conflicts While Git is an extremely powerful tool, it needs human intervention to resolve situations where there are conflicting changes. Conflicts are usually caused by the same lines being changed on both branches. Git will attempt to automatically merge the branches like it did when we updated our branches, but when it encounters a conflict, it will stop auto merging and show a CONFLICT error, highlighting the files in which conflicts are occurring. Example merge conflict message Auto merging practice/temperatures_function.py CONFLICT (content): Merge Conflict in practice/temperatures_function.py Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. Git will clearly mark the conflicting changes in the files and still automatically merge non-conflicting changes. Different editors give us different tools for handling these merge conflicts, though the principles remain the same. Open the file(s) listed in the CONFLICT error and scroll to find the conflict. The conflict will be marked by these strange lines: Example of a merge conflict in a file <<<<<<< HEAD Changes in the current checked-out branch. ====== Incoming changes from the source branch >>>>>>> source-branch-name The top bit above the double line is what we have in our branch, represented by the <<<<<<< HEAD statement. The bottom bit is the same line but saved in the branch we are merging from, represented by the >>>>>>> source-branch-name statement. To resolve the merge conflict, delete the line which you do not wish to keep, as well as anything to do with marking the conflict. So if we wanted to keep only what we had on the source branch, we would delete everything until we had just the line we wanted: Changes in the current checked-out branch. Then once all conflicts are resolved, we can stage and commit our merge. If we wanted to cancel the merge, we can do so simply with the following command: git merge --abort Try it out! Have a go at resolving a merge conflict in our working with branches walkthrough . Resolving Merge Conflicts in VS Code There are many tools and integrations that make finding and resolving merge conflicts easier. This includes most IDEs with Git integrations, with one particularly feature-rich IDE integration in VSCode. Note Visual Studio Code has introduced a new method of resolving conflicts, the three-way Merge Editor. There are instructions below on how to use the Merge Editor. To check which instructions you need to use, check if Settings > Git > Merge Editor is enabled or disabled. If enabled, read the Merge Editor instructions. Otherwise, continue reading the instructions below. In Visual Studio Code , you can open your file browser in the tools tab. Any files which have a merge conflict will have a little 'C' next to them here. Open the files which have these conflicts (in this case, temperatures_function.py). Scroll in the document to find the conflict. You will notice these strange lines where conflict has occurred: <<<<<< HEAD This line is the line in my branch. ======= This line is the line in main. >>>>>> main The top bit above the double line is what we have in our branch (our branch is represented by the <<<<<<< HEAD statement). This will be called the current change . The bottom bit is the same line but it's saved in the main branch (symbolised as >>>>>>> main ). This will be called the incoming change . Above the conflict, you'll see some options for what you can do. You can click accept current changes , accept incoming changes , or accept both changes . Picking one of these options will resolve the conflict. Alternatively, you can go ahead and simply edit the conflicted file directly. Edit the area of conflict until you're satisfied -- making sure to remove the === line, the >>>>> line, and any duplicated code. So, for example, if you wish to keep This line is the line in my branch , delete everything that's connected to the conflict so that it also shows this in your text editor: When you're done, simply save the file. This line is the line in my branch. Merge Editor Like before with VS Code, you can open your file browser in the tools tab and find any files which have a merge conflict with a little 'C' next to them here. Open the files which have these conflicts. Scroll in any of the three views to find the highlighted conflict. In the top two Theirs (incoming) and Yours (current) views, checkboxes are available to accept and combine changes in the incoming and current branches. The Results view can be edited directly, with the other views updated accordingly. Once complete, close the editor or click the Accept Merge button in the bottom right corner. If not all conflicts have been addressed, a warning will show. Best Practices for Branches and Pull Requests The main branch should be kept in a good stable state (always deployable with a relevant README file). Developers create feature branches from the main branch (main trunk) and work on them. The developer only creates a short-lived feature branch (a branch from the trunk) to prevent the challenge of merging later on. Once they are done, they create pull requests in GitHub. The request gets reviewed by a team member or a group of developers (if it is a refactor or large changes). The comments on changes stay directly on the GitHub page, and there may be discussions about the changes. Once these are done and all compiling and testing is complete, the reviewer will complete the merge. Protecting your main branch It is good to keep your main branch stable and working. That way, new branches can be made without worrying about pollution from unfinished or unchecked work, and stakeholders/clients can easily see progress currently made. To keep it that way, you can protect the main branch, which will ensure no unauthorised changes are made to it. Protecting a branch is not a feature built into Git, but instead a feature provided by remote repository hosts. Both GitHub and GitLab (as well as other remote repository providers) have the ability to restrict who and when a branch can be pushed to, merged into, locked, or deleted. What Next?

It contains the pull request's description, timeline, and comments the assignee or reviewer left. To merge a pull request, you have three options: Merge pull request: this will keep the entire commit history of the source branch and add it to the target branch. Creates a symbolic commit. Squash and merge: ticking this will merge the history of commits for the source branch into one commit. This can be useful when the pull request is not a major update, and you don't want your repository's history of commits to contain commits with messages such as \"fixed typo\" or \"replaced incorrectly placed image\". Creates a merged commit. Rebase and merge: add all source branch commits in front of the target branch's commits. Does not create a symbolic commit. The Commits tab displays a history of the pull request's commits. So, for example, if the reviewer decides that minor adjustments are required, and the assignee pushes these changes to Gitlab, then these commits will be captured in this tab. In the Files changed tab, can you see all the new changes in the pull request's source branch. You can also opt for a side-by-side comparison and see line-by-line how the master version and new branch version compare. You can also leave comments on any line of any file, which will also be recorded in the Conversation tab's timeline. Checks is part of the GitHub Actions functionality, which enhances your code review processes with apps and automated reviewing checks. This is inactive by default. If you are happy to merge the two branches, then select the type of pull request you wish to apply, and the pull request should be completed in a few seconds. Try it out! Have a go at raising a pull request and conducting a review with our pull request walkthrough .","title":"Pull Requests"},{"location":"training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/#merge-conflicts","text":"While Git is an extremely powerful tool, it needs human intervention to resolve situations where there are conflicting changes. Conflicts are usually caused by the same lines being changed on both branches. Git will attempt to automatically merge the branches like it did when we updated our branches, but when it encounters a conflict, it will stop auto merging and show a CONFLICT error, highlighting the files in which conflicts are occurring. Example merge conflict message Auto merging practice/temperatures_function.py CONFLICT (content): Merge Conflict in practice/temperatures_function.py Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. Git will clearly mark the conflicting changes in the files and still automatically merge non-conflicting changes. Different editors give us different tools for handling these merge conflicts, though the principles remain the same. Open the file(s) listed in the CONFLICT error and scroll to find the conflict. The conflict will be marked by these strange lines: Example of a merge conflict in a file <<<<<<< HEAD Changes in the current checked-out branch. ====== Incoming changes from the source branch >>>>>>> source-branch-name The top bit above the double line is what we have in our branch, represented by the <<<<<<< HEAD statement. The bottom bit is the same line but saved in the branch we are merging from, represented by the >>>>>>> source-branch-name statement. To resolve the merge conflict, delete the line which you do not wish to keep, as well as anything to do with marking the conflict. So if we wanted to keep only what we had on the source branch, we would delete everything until we had just the line we wanted: Changes in the current checked-out branch. Then once all conflicts are resolved, we can stage and commit our merge. If we wanted to cancel the merge, we can do so simply with the following command: git merge --abort Try it out! Have a go at resolving a merge conflict in our working with branches walkthrough .","title":"Merge Conflicts"},{"location":"training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/#resolving-merge-conflicts-in-vs-code","text":"There are many tools and integrations that make finding and resolving merge conflicts easier. This includes most IDEs with Git integrations, with one particularly feature-rich IDE integration in VSCode. Note Visual Studio Code has introduced a new method of resolving conflicts, the three-way Merge Editor. There are instructions below on how to use the Merge Editor. To check which instructions you need to use, check if Settings > Git > Merge Editor is enabled or disabled. If enabled, read the Merge Editor instructions. Otherwise, continue reading the instructions below. In Visual Studio Code , you can open your file browser in the tools tab. Any files which have a merge conflict will have a little 'C' next to them here. Open the files which have these conflicts (in this case, temperatures_function.py). Scroll in the document to find the conflict. You will notice these strange lines where conflict has occurred: <<<<<< HEAD This line is the line in my branch. ======= This line is the line in main. >>>>>> main The top bit above the double line is what we have in our branch (our branch is represented by the <<<<<<< HEAD statement). This will be called the current change . The bottom bit is the same line but it's saved in the main branch (symbolised as >>>>>>> main ). This will be called the incoming change . Above the conflict, you'll see some options for what you can do. You can click accept current changes , accept incoming changes , or accept both changes . Picking one of these options will resolve the conflict. Alternatively, you can go ahead and simply edit the conflicted file directly. Edit the area of conflict until you're satisfied -- making sure to remove the === line, the >>>>> line, and any duplicated code. So, for example, if you wish to keep This line is the line in my branch , delete everything that's connected to the conflict so that it also shows this in your text editor: When you're done, simply save the file.

The request gets reviewed by a team member or a group of developers (if it is a refactor or large changes).

Pull Requests vs Merge Requests Pull Requests and Merge Requests are two different names referring to the same feature on different platforms. On GitHub they are called Pull Requests and GitLab they are called Merge Requests. In this guide, we will refer to them as pull requests. A pull request starts the process of merging new code with a project's main branch. In this guide we go through the process of merging new code with a project's main branch. We will do this by opening a new pull request, then show you how you can discuss and review the changes with team members, adding new commits in response to comments, before finally merging into the project main branch. This guide won't show you how to resolve conflicting changes your branch might have when comparing to the main branch. Using Pull Request assist in the collaborative coding process by providing an easy platform for code review, checking and discussing new code before it goes into the main branch. This can help issues and errors to be caught earlier in an isolated environment where it is easier to resolve them. How to make a pull request The first step of making a pull request is to change the branch you are working on. You can do this by either \"checking out\" an existing branch or a new one. To learn more about branches see our Working with Branches walkthrough. Checkout an existing branch Checkout a new branch To checkout an existing branch, open a terminal (e.g. Bash Terminal ) and enter: git switch <branch-name> What if I want to checkout a remote branch? To update your local repository with all remote branch changes, in the terminal enter: git fetch To checkout a remote branch, in the terminal enter: git switch <branch-name> To create and checkout a new branch, open a terminal (e.g. Bash Terminal ) and enter: git checkout -b <branch-name> Note The naming convention of your branch names should follow a consistent style. We advise something like <branch type>/<project id>-<initials>-<ticket number>-<brief description> , but you can add and drop different parts where it suits you, for example: <initials>_<ticket-id>_<description> See our guidance on branch naming schemes for more details.

Working with branches is a core part of working with Git, allowing quick and safe collaboration with others (and yourself!) Knowing how to create , switch , delete , and merge branches are a vital skills and can be done both locally via Git and remotely via GitHub and GitLab. Sometimes conflicts between branches occurs and Git will need your input to solve these conflicts. However, Git makes them very easy to resolve, even if they look scary initially! Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note Intro to Git Necessary This guide assumes you are using Git to version control Using Git collaboratively Necessary It is important to be familiar with the concepts covered in this guide Committing Work Walkthrough Recommended Make sure you are confident with using the basic commands of Git first Check your current branch When performing some operations, it is useful to know your current branch. You can quickly confirm your current branch with the following command: git branch --show-current git status will also print the current branch at the top of the return message, as well as other useful information. Use it frequently. Creating a Branch Terminal GitHub GitLab Are you in the correct repository? Before you start, ensure that you are in the correct directory containing the local version of your repository: cd <project-filepath> To create a new branch, use the command: git checkout -b new-branch-name This command will both create and switch your repository to your new branch, based on the current branch. Create a branch from a different branch If you want your new branch to be based off a different branch than the one you are currently on, simply specify the name of that base branch: git checkout -b new-branch-name source-branch-name Publishing the new branch The branch you have created only exists on your local version of the repository and will need to be published on to the remote version of your repository: git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name To create a branch in GitHub, make sure you are on the Code screen of your repository, this is the default page you see when you navigate to your repository. Follows these steps: Click on the branches button, highlighted in blue below and showing the number of branches we currently have (which is currently 3). This will bring up the branches page. Click on the green New Branch button to the right. This will bring up the Create a branch popup. Enter a suitable name for your branch and select the branch source. The branch source is the version of the code that your new branch will be based on and diverging from, and is by default main, which should be a stable working version of your code. Click the green Create branch button when you are ready. Once created, you will be returned to the Code screen of the repository with the new branch checked out and ready to be viewed and worked on. Alternatively to the process above, you can click on the branches drop down menu and enter your new branch's name. If that branch doesn't already exist then an option to create a new branch will appear. The base branch will be set to the branch you are currently on and creating the new branch from. Change branches before you create the new branch if you want it to be different. Accessing your new remote branch on a local repository To access your new remote branch on your local repository, simply follow the instruction for Changing Branches in the Terminal. To create a new branch in GitLab: First navigate to the branches page by going to the side-menu on the left, then Repository then Branches . Select the New Branch button on the left in blue Enter your new branch's name in the Branch name field and from the Create from menu, select the source branch, which your new branch will be based upon. When ready, click the blue Create branch button. Changing Branch Terminal GitHub GitLab To change to a new branch: git switch target-branch-name git checkout vs git switch git switch is a recent addition to Git and the older git checkout can also switch branches: git checkout target-branch-name The addition of git switch is because git checkout has dual purposes, switching branches or restoring working tree files. This dual function can be a source of confusion for some users. The second function is not included in git switch but instead git restore . If you have already learnt to use git checkout to switch branches then that will continue to work, but if you are just learning git then it is better to use the more predicable git switch command. To switch branches in GitHub: Click on the branches drop down menu in the Code view of your repository. This is the button in the top left of the screen and will show the name of currently checked out branch. By default this will be main . Type in the name of your branch to find it or select it from the list. Alternatively, you can navigate to the \"Branches\" page of your repository and select the branch from there. To get to the \"Branches\" page, click on the button next to the branches drop down menu. Once you have switched branches, you will be returned to the Code view, which will show the code from the branch you have now checked out with its name shown in the branch drop down menu. To switch branches in GitLab: Click on the branches drop down menu in the Files view of your repository. This is the button in the top left of the screen and will show the name of currently checked out branch. By default this will be main or master . Type in the name of your branch to find it or select it from the list. Once you have switched branches, you will be returned to the Files view, which will show the code from the branch you have now checked out with its name shown in the branch drop down menu. Help, I can't see the branch I have created locally on my remote repository (GitHub/GitLab)? If you have created a new branch on a local clone of the repository but cannot see it on GitHub, then you might not have pushed it and set your local branch to track the upstream one. You can quickly check a local branch's branch tracking info with git status --short --branch or git status -sb : Expected return when a branch has it's upstream set correctly git status -sb ## branch-name...origin/branch-name If the branch does not have a remote branch set then only the first part will show. Expected return when a branch has it's upstream has not been set git status -sb ## branch-name To set the upstream, push with the --set-upstream ( -u ) flag: git push -u branch-name Deleting a Branch Terminal GitHub GitLab Deleting a branch is a two step process. Just like how when creating a branch you create it both locally and on the repote repo, when deleting you have to delete the branch locally and also delete the remote branch. To delete the branch locally git branch -d target-branch-name To delete the branch remotely: git push origin --delete target-branch-name You can also use the shorter command to delete remotely: git push origin :target-branch-name Error when deleting a remote branch If you get the error below, it may mean that someone else has already deleted the branch. error: unable to push to unqualified destination: remoteBranchName The destination refspec neither matches an existing ref on the remote nor begins with refs/, and we are unable to guess a prefix based on the source ref. error: failed to push some refs to 'git@repository_name' Try to synchronize your branch list using: git fetch -p The -p flag means \"prune\". After fetching, branches which no longer exist on the remote will be deleted. To delete a branch on GitHub: Click on the branches button, highlighted in blue below and showing the number of branches we currently have (which is currently 4). This will bring up the branches page. Find the branch you wish to delete and click on the bin icon to the far right of it. This will instantly delete the branch. It will show as deleted on the branch page, however, it can be easily recovered with the Restore button on the far right. This is useful when you mistakenly delete a branch. To delete a branch on GitLab: First navigate to the branches page by going to the side-menu on the left, then Repository then Branches . Search for the branch you wish to delete. When found, click the Delete bin icon to the right of the screen. Clicking the bin icon will bring up a warning about deleting the branch.

Merging Branches Terminal GitHub GitLab Remember to ensure local branches are up to date with their remote version git checkout source-branch-name git pull git checkout target-branch-name git pull Or if you don't mind which branches are updated: Update all of your branches at once git pull --all While all using the same git merge commands, there are a number of different merges that you might want to carry out: Updating a Feature Branch with changes in Main git checkout feature/branch-name git merge main Merging your Feature Branch changes to Main git checkout main git merge feature/branch-name Merging one branch into another git checkout target-branch-name git merge source-branch-name When merging, if Git detects a conflict, it will stop the merge and raise and error that would look like the following: Auto-merging practice/temperatures_function.py CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge Conflict in practice/temperatures_function.py Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result. If this occurs, then continue on to look at our walkthrough on resolving merge conflicts Merging on GitHub is done through pull requests, see our walkthrough for more instructions . Merging on GitLab is done through merge requests, see our walkthrough for more instructions . Resolving Merge Conflicts Terminal GitHub GitLab When merging, if Git detects a conflict, it will stop the merge and raise an error that would look like the following: Auto-merging practice/temperatures_function.py CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge Conflict in practice/temperatures_function.py Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result. To resolve this error, we are going to find out where the merge conflicts are happening, make a choice of which version of changes to keep (which can be both), before staging the file and completing the merge with a commit (which we can then push). To find the offending file, we look at the second line of the conflict error where it is listed: practice/temperatures_function.py . Open the file(s) in an editor of your choosing and look for the conflicting section of the document: The conflict will look something like this: <<<<<< HEAD This line is the line in my branch. ======= This line is the line in main. >>>>>> main Delete the content that you do not wish to keep, including the arrows and double lines. If we only wished to keep changes from our branch the result will look like this: This line is the line in my branch. Search for any remaining conflicts in this file and other files. Once you have found and corrected all of them, save your changes and update your branch in the usual way: git status # (1)! git add . git status git commit -m \"Merge branch 'source-branch-name' into 'target-branch-name'\" # (2)! git status git push The git status commands are not required, but is good practice to keep track of the current state of the repository to understand what you have done. This is an example of a good merge commit message, but you can use whatever message you want When you create a Pull Request in GitHub it will check the compatibility of the two branches (base and source) and detect if there are any merge conflicts that are expected to occur. If it does find conflicts, it will not allow the merge to proceed until they are resolved. To resolve the conflicts: First, click on the Resolve conflicts button on the right of the \"This branch has conflicts that must be resolved\" message box. This will bring up the conflict resolution page. Select a file with a conflict in it and find the conflicting section: The conflict will look something like this: <<<<<< HEAD New change on feature branch ======= Conflicting change on target branch >>>>>> main Delete the content that you do not wish to keep, including the arrows and double lines. Navigate to the next conflict with the Next v botton. Once all conflicts in a file are resolved then the Mark as resolved button will become available. Click the button. A green checkmark will appear next to the file you have resolved. Resolve all other files and a green Commit merge button will appear at the top of the Merge Editor space. Commit the merge. Once the merge has been completed, the merge health section of the PR will show as green and healthy (assuming there are not any more review steps to go through) . When you create a Merge Request in GitLab it will check the compatibility of the two branches (base and source) and detect if there are any merge conflicts that are expected to occur. If it does find conflicts, it will not allow the merge to proceed until they are resolved. To resolve the conflicts: First click on the blue Resolve Conflicts button to the right of the \"Merge blocked: merge conflicts must be resolved\" message. This will open up the Merge Conflicts editor which has two different mode, Interactive or Edit Inline. Select the option that best works for you. Interactive Mode Inline Mode For each conflict, the changes from each branch will be shown in green for \"ours\" or the source branch and blue for \"theirs\" or the target branch over the overall merge. To the right there are buttons to select which version to use. Select the appropriate version. Once all conflicts are resolved, the blue Commit to source branch will become available. Make any changes you wish to the commit message and commit the merge. Each conflict will be marked something like this: <<<<<< HEAD New change on feature branch ======= Conflicting change on target branch >>>>>> main Delete the content that you do not wish to keep, including the arrows and double lines. Once all conflicts are resolved, the blue Commit to source branch will become available. Make any changes you wish to the commit message and commit the merge. Once the merge conflicts have been resolved and committed, you will return to the merge request. A banner at the top will confirm all conflicts have been resolved and the previous \"Merge blocked: merge conflicts must be resolved\" message box will now show \"Ready to merge!\".","title":"Working with Branches"},{"location":"training_resources/git/git_walkthroughs/working_with_branches_walkthrough/#_1","text":"TLDR This is a beginner friendly guide on how to work and collaborate with Git for the first time.

This dual function can be a source of confusion for some users. The second function is not included in git switch but instead git restore . If you have already learnt to use git checkout to switch branches then that will continue to work, but if you are just learning git then it is better to use the more predicable git switch command.

Alternatively, you can install the GitHub CLI and authenticate using gh auth login to authenticate with your GitHub Account. The method used in this guide will be generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub and using the Git Credential Manager to store it. This is a widely reliable method. Creating a GitHub Account Info You don't have to use the same email you used to configure your installation of Git . Another email can be used if you wish. Creating a personal GitHub account is free and easy. Simply, got to the GitHub website and click the Sign Up button in the top-right corner (or follow the link provided). Once signed up, validate the email address you signed up with. Some of the next steps are not possible without a validated email address. If you have any issues with email verification, consult the GitHub Docs on verifying you email address . Generating a Personal Access Token (PAT) Here we give a cut down guide to making your own PAT. See the full Github docs for more details Warning Treat Personal Access Tokens like passwords. Store them securely and do not share them. If you are worried that a PAT might be compromised (or you haven't used one in a while) consider revoking it. In the upper-right corner of any page on the GitHub website , click your profile picture, then click Settings Towards the bottom of the left sidebar, click <> Developer Settings In the left sidebar, under Personal access tokens , click Tokens (classic) . Select Generate new token , then click Generate new token (classic) . Give your token a descriptive name under Token name , e.g. \"Git Desktop Token\". To give your token an expiration, select the Expiration drop-down menu, then select a default, use the calendar picker, or select 'No expiration' so the token will never expire. tokens without expiration dates It can be tempting to make tokens without expiration for convenience, but when you have a lot of them, its easy to leave old unused tokens laying around, potentially acting as security holes into our systems. It's usually more secure to set an expiry date (e.g. 6 months) so any old tokens become useless after a period. Select a scope for the token. For this guide, only the repo scope will be selected, but other scopes are available if you intend to do other things with the PAT. PAT Token Scope It is advised to give a PAT only the scope required for it's use. At the bottom of the page, under the scope table, click Generate Token . Copy your new PAT and store it in a secure location for later use. You won't be able to see it again. To use your token to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, authorise the token. Click Configure SSO and select the organisation you wish to authorise. Using your PAT on your local Git installation When you go to clone or otherwise access a GitHub repository, you will be prompted for your username and password. You can use your PAT instead of your password. In the command line: $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git Username: YOUR_USERNAME Password: YOUR_TOKEN HTTPS vs SSH keys You might come across SSH protocol keys, as it is essentially another option to create a password and verify your credentials. This section on HTTPS vs SSH protocol options explains the differences between these two options. There are pros and cons for both, we would recommend the HTTPS option for Git beginners. PATs will only allow you use HTTPs Git operation. If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to switch the remote from SSH to HTTPs. See this guide from GitHub for more details. When you go to access a Git repository in the future, you should not be prompted for your username and password as your credentials will be cached on your computer. Read this guide on caching credentials from GitHub for more details. Troubleshooting credentials You might see something like this at any point: remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied remote: You must use a personal access with 'read_repository or 'write_repository' scope for Git over HTTP. remote: You can generate one at https:// etc etc... remote: Authentication failed for 'repository address you're attempting to git clone' This can mean a number of things: either your access token has expired or you have entered the wrong access token for your password (or username even). If your access token has expired or is about to expire, you can check by going to the [GitHub Personal Access Tokens (Classic)] page to check the expiration date. To fix this we need to create a new access token . If you have an existing repository If you don't have an existing repository Next, in the command terminal type git pull -v (v stands for verification). This should prompt a new git credentials window. In the terminal type git clone <url> but with the new credentials included in the URL, so: git clone https://<username>:<NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>@<domain>/example.git Try it out In this section, we will run through the steps of creating a new repository on GitHub, before cloning it to your local machine using Git. Try It Out Log into GitHub Create a new repository Select the owner of the repository. If you are a part of an organisation then this will be available. However, in this instance just select your own account. Give the repository a descriptive but short name , for example \"my_first_repository\". Give the repository a short description , for example \"This is my first repository\". Set the privacy of the repository. In this case, Private is selected. Select Add a README file so there is something in the repository when we create it. This is not necessary for repositories, you can create them empty. What is the README? The README.md file is a markdown file that is used to tell other people about your project. It should communicate important information about your project, including: What you project does Why the project is useful How users can get started with the project Where uses can get help with your project Who maintains and contributes to the project Click the green Create Repository button at the bottom to create the repository. Once created, the repository will be shown. Select the green <> Code menu to the right and copy the HTTPS URL shown. To clone the new repository onto your local machine, open Git Bash. In a suitable directory, here the $HOME (C:/Users/$USER) directory is used, run the git clone command with the copied repository URL. git clone https://github.com/josephwilson8-nhs/my_first_repository If you have already configured your Git installation with a Personal Access Token (PAT) then this should run. However, if it prompts you for your username and password, complete the above sections on generating a PAT and using a PAT . You can move into this repository with the cd , change directories, command. cd my_first_repository/ Now in this repository, we can examine the currently set remotes for the repository, which will be the address of our repository that we created on GitHub. git remote -v Finally, we can inspect the repository in Windows File Explorer. Note Due to some settings and extensions used, there might be some small differences in what you see when viewing the repository in Windows File Explorer. In the picture above, hidden files have been made visible through a setting change, and an extension to Windows Explorer is being used to render the README markdown for the preview. Accessing the NHS Digital Organisation If you work in NHS England then your team or directorate will likely have their own processes and ways of working on GitHub, including onboarding processes. If you work within the Data Science Skill Team, there is a onboarding guide on confluence . Next Steps Now that you have set up your GitHub account to communicate with your local Git installation, you might also want to set up your access to GitLab . Alternatively, you can start learning about how to use git to collaborate with others ; learning about branches, pull and merge requests, and how to deal with conflicting changes.

(equi-JOIN was ten times faster than this) computing 30 columns didn't take much longer than 1 column for non-JOIN options and play with the code straight away Introduction \u00b6 There are a load of different ways we can do row-wise analyses in Pyspark - lets see how a number of common approach compare. In this guide we will make 10,000,000 rows of fake data full of \"ages\", and then try following techniques on 1, 10 and 30 columns to see how long they take, and ultimately crown one, the champion. Consider also checking out our recommended Pyspark Style Guide . Techniques : CASE WHEN pandas UDF - pandas.cut UDF - if then else JOIN BETWEEN equi-JOIN Author : NHS Digital Data Science Squad Setup \u00b6 Spark Setup \u00b6 First a bit of code to make this work using PySpark in Google Colab. Basically it just installs PySpark and makes the spark session In [ ]: Copied! try : # this is wrapped in a try except so that if it fails # (i.e. it's not run in colab, such as in databricks) this will catch it. import google.colab IN_COLAB = True % pip install pyspark # in Colab we need to install pyspark except : IN_COLAB = False try: # this is wrapped in a try except so that if it fails # (i.e. it's not run in colab, such as in databricks) this will catch it. import google.colab IN_COLAB = True %pip install pyspark # in Colab we need to install pyspark except: IN_COLAB = False In [2]: Copied! if IN_COLAB : # in colab we also need to make the Spark session # (in Databricks this comes premade) from pyspark.sql import SparkSession spark = ( SparkSession . builder . master ( \"local\" ) . appName ( \"Colab\" ) . config ( 'spark.ui.port' , '4050' ) . getOrCreate () ) if IN_COLAB: # in colab we also need to make the Spark session # (in Databricks this comes premade) from pyspark.sql import SparkSession spark = (SparkSession .builder .master(\"local\") .appName(\"Colab\") .config('spark.ui.port', '4050') .getOrCreate() ) Import Modules \u00b6 We need to import all the functions etc. that we will use In [3]: Copied! import pandas as pd import numpy as np from pyspark.sql.functions import ( pandas_udf , PandasUDFType , lit , col , when , array , split , explode , isnull , udf ) import pandas as pd import numpy as np from pyspark.sql.functions import (pandas_udf, PandasUDFType, lit, col, when,array, split, explode, isnull, udf) Get Data \u00b6 First we need 10,000,000 rows of data to test the functions on. You can find a function and code snippet to generate this below. The reason why this is a quite complicated, is that to get the truest performance we need a table, on the disk (not some data held in memory), hence the code below has a lot of extra bits to make sure it writes to the disk. To allow us to write large tables, it does it in batches (this means we could make a table of any size and really heavily test these approaches.

In this instance we actually use a blob of SQL to do the CASE WHEN statement! Here is some guidance on how to do this in both Spark SQL and Pyspark . This should be pretty efficient, because pyspark can easily map this across the whole dataset. Conventionally, doing this for 30 columns in SQL would have a real pain, however we use python (sring formatting) to basically use this one set of SQL code for all 30 columns!

This shouldn't be the fastest because the programme needs to convert the python code into the underlying language that spark uses. In this instance, our Python code uses \"if..else\" logic, so not unlike CASE WHEN. You can see guidance on UDFs here .

(Pandas uses Numpy, which is veeeery efficient). In this instance, our PandasUDF is using the pandas.cut function to split the data into buckets for each age. This could be amongst the fastest approaches, but it also a bit fiddly to set up and understand (though not so bad once you understand it!) You can see more guidance on using the new Spark 3.0 PandasUDFs here or an older blog on PandasUDFs here .

However, in Pyspark, JOINs are a \"wide\" operation, which are generally not as efficient as \"long\" operations (such as CASE WHEN / UDF / Pandas UDF). First we need to make the agegroup_lookup reference data table, which has an upper_age , lower_age and corresponding age_group . In [9]: Copied! # first we make a agegroup lookup dataframe agegroup_lookup = pd .

The most obvious way is to simply use BETWEEN to check for each record, if the age is between the upper and lower ages described in the lookup and then return the agegroup. This probably won't be very efficient, because \"non-equi-JOINs\" (i.e. JOINs without an \"=\" within the ON statement) do an implicit CROSS JOIN and so aren't very efficient.

This should be a lot more efficient than the non-equi-JOIN.

That means we follow standard Python organisation of modules, functions, tests, etc., but where we do data manipulation we drop to PySpark. PySpark gives you many ways to accomplish operations. We do not lay out all of the different options here because it would be confusing. Instead, these examples give you the single approach that we have chosen to use. it is perfectly valid for you to choose a different way. We avoid using pandas or koalas because it adds another layer of learning. The PySpark method chaining syntax is easy to learn, easy to read, and will be familiar for anyone who has used SQL. There does not yet seem to be a style convention for PySpark so we have adapted this style guide . You can also find a tutorial script containing lots of code snippets here. In-built PySpark functions Using functions is preferred to writing spark SQL to support testing and encapsulation. This preference is not a rule. PySpark makes a lot of use of functions imported from spark.sql.functions library. Almost any function that you might find in SQL should be available in this library. The docs contain the full list of functions . Our convention is to import these all under F: from pyspark.sql import functions as F Then you would use the functions like: F . col () F . max () F . datediff () Reading a table To get started we will usually want to read a table from a database into a DataFrame. df = spark . table ( 'my_database.my_table' ) Select The Spark equivalent of SQL's SELECT is the .select() method. This method takes multiple arguments - one for each column you want to select. These arguments can either be the column name as a string (one for each column) or a column object (using the df.colName syntax). If you are using Spark version before 3.0 then do this: df = ( df . select ( F . col ( \u2018 AGE \u2019 ), F . col ( \u2018 CHOLESTEROL \u2019 )) ) Notice the indentation of the parentheses is different from python. This is following the palantir style guide listed above. This convention become more valuable when we see longer examples. Casting data types Spark differs from SQL in that it is 'schema-on-read'. This means that when you import data into PySpark, it will try to guess the datatypes of your columns unless you explicitly provide a schema. In general, it is good practice to set the data types as soon as you read in data. In our approach, we use the initial .select() statement to (1) rename columns to follow our naming convention and (2) cast data types where necessary. This ensures everything is tidy before we start complex operations. my_df = ( my_df . select ( F . col ( \"NHS_NUMBER\" ) . cast ( \"String\" ) . alias ( \"NHS_NUMBER\" ), F . col ( \"BirthDate\" ) . cast ( \"Date\" ) . alias ( \"BIRTH_DATE\" ), F . col ( \"Appointments_count\" ) . cast ( \"Integer\" ) . alias ( \"APPOINTMENTS_COUNT\" ) ) ) Filter The .filter() method is the Spark counterpart of SQL's WHERE clause.: my_df = ( my_df . filter ( F . col ( \u2018 MY_VALUE \u2019 ) >= 4 ) ) Renaming columns Changing a column name is simple: df = ( df . withColumnRenamed ( \u2018 old name \u2019 , \u2018 NEW_NAME \u2019 ) ) For example: diabetes_data = ( diabetes_data . withColumnRenamed ( \u2018 Birth_date \u2019 , \u2018 BIRTH_DATE \u2019 ) ) Aggregations The syntax for aggregation is very similar to SQL, but with a different order: df = ( df . groupby ( F . col ( \u2018 YEAR \u2019 )) . agg ( F . sum ( F . col ( \u2018 SALES \u2019 )) . alias ( \u2018 TOTAL_SALES \u2019 ), F . min ( F . col ( 'SALES' )) . alias ( 'MIN_SALES' ), F . max ( F . col ( 'SALES' )) . alias ( 'MAX_SALES' ) ) ) Note how alias() is used to rename the aggregations. Method chaining Method chaining is one of the nicest features of PySpark as it allows you to do one operation after another in a very readable manner. You have already seen lots of examples of method chaining in this guide but here we address it directly. Here is an example that contains many of the operations you might want to perform on a dataset: df2 = ( df1 . select ( F . col ( \u2018 FIELD_ONE \u2019 ), F . col ( \u2018 FIELD_TWO \u2019 )) . filter ( F . col ( 'FIELD_TWO' ) > 10 ) . agg () ) Notice that we have put parentheses '()' around the entire query and we put the '.' at the beginning of each new line This approach contrasts to using the other common approach of having backslashes in the code. E.g. (DON\u2019T DO THIS) df2 = df1 \\ . select ( \u2018 FIELD_ONE \u2019 , \u2018 FIELD_TWO \u2019 ) \\ . filter ( \u2018 FIELD_TWO > 10 ) \\ . agg () It is recommended the chain lines to be no more than 6-7 lines. Try to avoid long chains and opt to break the code into logical steps. Joins in PySpark You should always explicitly specify the type of join in PySpark. If you do not specify the type of join in PySpark then it will default to inner join. Explicit is better than implicit. Even if the aim is to do an inner join, always specify the \u2018how\u2019 part of the join: Here is an example of good practice where we specify a left join: df_3 = ( df_1 . join ( df_2 , on = \u2019 NHS_NUMBER \u2019 , how = \u2019 left \u2019 ) . select ( df_1 [ * ], df_2 [ 'FIELD_1' , 'FIELD_2' ]) ) Notice above how the joining field \u2018on\u2019 condition is also specified. In situations where you need to join on multiple fields do this: df_3 = ( df_1 . join ( df_2 , ( df_1 . NHS_NUMBER == df_2 . NHS_NUMBER ) & ( df_1 . CCG == df_2 . CCG ), how = \u2019 left \u2019 ) . select ( df_1 [ * ], df_2 [ 'FIELD_1' , 'FIELD_2' ]) ) In the example above, the single joining field \u2018on\u2019 condition has been replaced with the multiple joining field conditions. Add a new column: .withColumn() To simply add a new column to your dataset: df = df . withColumn ( \"MyNewColumnName\" , < insert your conditions here > ) Suppose you want to add a new flag to your data (Yes = 1, No = 0), when a patient has had a chest x-ray or not: df = ( df . withColumn ( \"X-RAY_FLAG\" , F . when ( F . col ( \"X-RAY_DATE\" ) . isnotNull (), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 )) ) This will result to an extra column in the dataset that contains the flag values we just assigned with the (case) F.when condition. Adding values to new columns If you want to create an empty column never use \u2018NA\u2019 or a blank string \u2018 \u2018 to fill in the rows of said column. Instead use None: df = df . withColumn ( \u2018 MyEmptyColumnName \u2019 , F . lit ( None )) Or, here's an example where two new columns are created with the constant values of 1 and 2 in each column respectively. df = ( df . withColumn ( \u2018 MyColumnName1 \u2019 , F . lit ( 1 )) . withColumn ( 'MyColumnName2' , F . lit ( 2 )) ) PySpark inside a Python function We can create functions like in python, same logic applies, but instead using PySpark style: def group_by_and_count_column ( data : df , column_name : str ): \"\"\" Groups by specified column and returns count per grouping and sorts by descending order. Args: dataset we are reading from & the column we wish to group by Returns: groups from column and count \"\"\" # Group by CCG Code and count number of records per CCG df_count = df . groupBy ( df . column_name ) . count () # sort by CCG Code descending order result = df_count . sort ( desc ( \"count\" )) return result Reordering columns using a list To reorder columns in a table, create a list of the columns in the order you wish them to be: columns_order = [ \"NHS_NUMBER\" , \"CCG\" , \"APPOINTMENT\" , \"APPOINTMENT_DATE\" , etc ] And then apply to the dataframe: new_df = ( old_df . select ( * columns_order ) ) The asterisk is required to unpack the list in the select statement. Operations across multiple columns using a list Suppose you have flag columns in your dataset, whether a patient has attended an appointment or not, or a patient has completed a course of treatment. You can sum each of the flags on a record level by using a list and by adding an extra column using .withColumn() to the dataset with the sum result for each record: flags_sum = [ \"APP_ATTENDED\" , \"TREATMENT_COMPLETE\" ] After creating the list of flags we can now proceed to the final step: new_df = ( old_df . withColumn ( \"PATIENT_SCORE\" , sum ( old_df [ item ] for item in flags_sum )) ) Now you have a new column called PATIENT_SCORE that contains the sum of the specified flags for each Patient/row of data. Passing in column definitions to .withColumn() To add derivations and fields definitions to the final processing table, simply follow the .withColumn() logic as before: final_table = ( previous_step_df . withColumn ( \"SMOKING_NUMERATOR\" , smoking_numerator ) . withColumn ( \"TOTAL_NUM_PATIENTS\" , sum_of_patients ) . etc ) The 2nd argument of .withColumn() is a variable created at a separate step in the workflow, for example: smoking_numerator = ( F . when (( F . col ( \"SMOKING_VALUE\" ) >= 5 ) & ( F . col ( \"AGE\" ) >= 18 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) The above field definition is an application of a SQL-like CASE WHEN in PySpark. Field definitions can be complex, with a lot of condition statements and potential dependencies. To learn more about structuring your code and creating field definitions: To learn more about field definitions and how to use them Using these field definitions to write test cases with customers Once you've written your field definitions, next step is to write the unit tests to ensure that the definitions work as intended and are future-proof to bugs and errors: Writing unit tests for field definitions Passing in a list of aggregations to apply To pass a list of aggregations, as in the previous examples, create a variable that contains the specified aggregations: aggregate_fields = ( F . sum ( \"REGISTRATIONS\" ) . alias ( \"TOTAL_REGISTRATIONS\" ), F . count ( \"NHS_NUMBER\" ) . alias ( \"ALL_PATIENTS\" ), F . round ( F . sum ( \"REGISTRATIONS\" ) * 100 / F . count ( \"NHS_NUMBER\" ), 2 ) . alias ( \"REGISTRATIONS_PERCENTAGE\" ), ) Then apply to the final table to produce the aggregated output: aggregated_output = ( final_table . agg ( * aggregate_fields ) .< apply other conditions here , i . e . adding new columns or sorting the column order > ) Print the output aggregated_output.show() Create your own schema If you wish to create your own custom schema, here's how to do it: schema = StructType ([ StructField ( \"id\" , IntegerType (), True ), StructField ( \"colour\" , StringType (), True ), StructField ( \"rate\" , FloatType (), True ), StructField ( \"date\" , DateType (), True ) ]) Performance - caching and lazy operations Lazy evaluation in Spark means that the execution will not start until an action is triggered. When we call for an operation to execute, it does not execute immediately. Spark maintains the record of which operation is being called. General tips and tricks Try to keep your code in logical structured blocks. For example, if you have multiple lines referencing the same things, try to keep them together. Separating them reduces context and readability. Try to be as explicit and descriptive as possible when naming functions or variables. Strive to capture what the function is actually doing as opposed to naming it based the objects used inside of it. Think twice about introducing new import aliases, unless there is a good reason to do so. Some of the established ones are types and functions from PySpark from pyspark.sql import types as T, functions as F. Avoid using literal strings or integers in filtering conditions, new values of columns etc. Instead, to capture their meaning, extract them into variables, constants, dicts or classes as suitable. This makes the code more readable and enforces consistency across the repository.

I've chosen a style that will be familiar to SQL users but that will also be compatible with testing the code. Note that this script was first written for one team in a specific context so you will not currently be able to run the code or follow along. We will try to set up an example with dummy data soon so everyone can run this code The code is now out-of-date so needs updating but hopefully still useful as-is. Setup \u00b6 The following section, until code line 60, it is built assuming the presence of AWS Workspace, and all relevant packages are installed In [ ]: Copied! import findspark findspark . init ( spark_home = r \"C:\\Program Files\\spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7\" ) import findspark findspark.init(spark_home=r\"C:\\Program Files\\spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7\") In [ ]: Copied! import toml import pyspark from pyspark import SparkConf from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql import functions as F from pyspark.sql import dataframe as DF import toml import pyspark from pyspark import SparkConf from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql import functions as F from pyspark.sql import dataframe as DF First, set up credentials and connections for importing the databases. Details not shown here as they will be specific to your setup. At the start of our script, we type the following to create the spark application entry point, the beginning of the spark session for this script. In [ ]: Copied! spark = SparkSession \\ . builder \\ . getOrCreate () spark = SparkSession\\ .builder\\ .getOrCreate() In [ ]: Copied! # Set up the connection to read from the different data tables HES = spark . read . jdbc ( url = conn_str_CASU , table = 'HES_Diabetes_comps_1011to1920' , properties = conn_properties ) # Set up the connection to read from the different data tables HES = spark.read.jdbc(url=conn_str_CASU, table='HES_Diabetes_comps_1011to1920', properties=conn_properties) In [ ]: Copied!

CCG . filter ( F . col ( \"STATUS CODE\" ) != \"C\" ) . show () CCG.filter(F.col(\"STATUS CODE\") != \"C\").show() Notice how the filter text works just like SQL This is equivalent to the 'where' clause in SQL Selecting columns \u00b6 Let's select CCG Code , OPEN_DATE , CLOSE_DATE , and PRESCRIBING_SETTING In [ ]: Copied! CCG_2 = CCG . select ( F . col ( 'CCG Code' ), F . col ( 'OPEN_DATE' ), F . col ( 'CLOSE_DATE' ), F . col ( 'PRESCRIBING_SETTING' )) CCG_2 . show () CCG_2 = CCG.select(F.col('CCG Code'), F.col('OPEN_DATE'), F.col('CLOSE_DATE'), F.col('PRESCRIBING_SETTING')) CCG_2.show() Notice how the .show() is broken into steps compared to line 90 where .show() is applied in one line Aggregating data \u00b6 Group by CCG Code and count number of records per CCG In [ ]: Copied! CCG_Code_count = ( CCG . groupBy ( F . col ( \"CCG Code\" )) . count () ) CCG_Code_count = ( CCG .groupBy(F.col(\"CCG Code\")) .count() ) sort by CCG Code descending order In [ ]: Copied!

We put the results of the multiplication in a new column, PRE_MULT In [ ]: Copied! CCG_2 = CCG_2 . withColumn ( 'NEW_COL' , CCG . PRESCRIBING_SETTING * 10 ) CCG_2 . show () CCG_2 = CCG_2.withColumn('NEW_COL', CCG.PRESCRIBING_SETTING*10) CCG_2.show() Renaming columns \u00b6 You can rename columns with the .withColumnRenamed() method: In [ ]: Copied! CCG_2 = CCG_2 . withColumnRenamed ( 'CCG Code' , 'NEW_CCG_CODE' ) CCG_2 . show () CCG_2 = CCG_2.withColumnRenamed('CCG Code', 'NEW_CCG_CODE') CCG_2.show() Joins - 1 \u00b6 Let's join the two dataframes back together. We will try to join on CCG.CCG CODE = CCG_2.NEW_CCG_CODE In [ ]: Copied! CCG_3 = CCG . join ( CCG_2 , CCG [ 'CCG CODE' ] == CCG_2 [ 'NEW_CCG_CODE' ], how = 'leftouter' ) CCG_3 . show () CCG_3 = CCG.join(CCG_2, CCG['CCG CODE'] == CCG_2['NEW_CCG_CODE'], how='leftouter') CCG_3.show() Notice how this time we used CCG['CCG CODE'] instead of CCG.CCG CODE . That is because there is a space in CCG CODE The two approached are generally equivalent Joins - 2 \u00b6 Often in SQL we want to join tables, then select '*' from table one but only one column from table 2 Let's see what that looks like In [ ]: Copied! CCG_3 = ( CCG . join ( CCG_2 , CCG [ 'CCG CODE' ] == CCG_2 [ 'NEW_CCG_CODE' ], how = 'leftouter' ) . select ( CCG [ \"*\" ], CCG_2 [ \"NEW_COL\" ]) ) CCG_3 . show () CCG_3 = ( CCG .join(CCG_2, CCG['CCG CODE'] == CCG_2['NEW_CCG_CODE'], how='leftouter') .select(CCG[\"*\"], CCG_2[\"NEW_COL\"]) ) CCG_3.show() Method chaining \u00b6 In the example above, you can see that we combined multiple steps into a single query. This feature is one of the best parts of PySpark and is called 'method chaining'. The downside of the example above is that it is a very long line and is visually complex. To get around this, the style is to wrap the query over several lines. Good practice looks like this: In [ ]: Copied! CCG_3 = ( CCG . join ( CCG_2 , CCG [ 'CCG CODE' ] == CCG_2 [ 'NEW_CCG_CODE' ], how = 'leftouter' ) . select ( CCG [ \"*\" ], CCG_2 [ \"NEW_COL\" ]) ) CCG_3 = ( CCG .join(CCG_2, CCG['CCG CODE'] == CCG_2['NEW_CCG_CODE'], how='leftouter') .select(CCG[\"*\"], CCG_2[\"NEW_COL\"]) ) Notice that this time we have put parentheses () around the query Notice also that we put the . at the beginning of each new line You can extend this chains as long as needed but take care that they don't become difficult to follow. Consider splitting this out into discrete, logical steps: In [ ]: Copied! \"\"\" CCG_3 = ( CCG .join(CCG_2, CCG['CCG CODE'] == CCG_2['NEW_CCG_CODE'], how='leftouter') .select(CCG[\"*\"], CCG_2[\"NEW_COL\"]) .filter(...) .withColumn(flag1, ...) .withColumn(flag2, ...) .withColumn(flag3, flag1+flag2) ,withColumn('tt_num_3', tt_num_3()) .join(...) .groupBy(...) ) \"\"\" \"\"\" CCG_3 = ( CCG .join(CCG_2, CCG['CCG CODE'] == CCG_2['NEW_CCG_CODE'], how='leftouter') .select(CCG[\"*\"], CCG_2[\"NEW_COL\"]) .filter(...) .withColumn(flag1, ...) .withColumn(flag2, ...) .withColumn(flag3, flag1+flag2) ,withColumn('tt_num_3', tt_num_3()) .join(...) .groupBy(...) ) \"\"\" PySpark applied to diabetes \u00b6 Prep the data \u00b6 We might want to impose a full schema here but for now I'll just fix the dates Following the style guide here: https://github.com/palantir/pyspark-style-guide , I will select only the columns I need and will rename/cast them at the same time Notice how we make sure that the columns follow correct naming conventions at the earliest possible point. This will avoid workarounds later Coding principles \u00b6 Select only those fields you need - avoid 'SELECT *' Rename and cast the data types of variables as early as possible --- nothing should get past the first select statement unless it follows the [NAMING_CONVENTION] for diabetes columns Use the F.function() style. This allows us to understand which version of a function you are using. When joining tables, aim to cut down the table to only the required fields before you join Set up the connection to read from the different data tables: In [ ]: Copied!

Mistakes can easily be made in translating from one code base to another. By following the steps in this guide, we can create a set of tests which will check that the outputs of the new code match the outputs of the old code. First, we need the output from the old code in a CSV, to compare to the CSV which is produced by the new code. This should match the format of the new version, i.e. tidy data .

Path ( < path > ) target_df = pd . read_csv ( TARGET_DIR / 'target.csv' ) gtruth_df = pd . read_csv ( GTRUTH_DIR / 'gtruth.csv' ) Pandas Dataframes have some inbuilt attributes which we can now compare. For example, to check that they have the same number of rows and columns, we use .shape : assert target_df . shape == gtruth_df . shape , 'Target has a different number of rows and/or columns to ground truth' The assert function runs the condition target_df.shape == gtruth_df.shape . It does nothing if the condition is True, but raises an assertion error if the condition is False. We can decide what to write as a helpful error message, in this case: 'Target has a different number of rows and/or columns to ground truth' . Find out more about Python assert here . We can write more tests to run various comparisons of the two CSVs, e.g.: Check that they have the same column names in the same order: assert target_df . columns . tolist () == gtruth_df . columns . tolist () Finally, check the contents of each column are the same. for each_col in gtruth_df . columns : assert ( gtruth_df [ each_col ] . equals ( target_df [ each_col ])) You may think of other tests appropriate to your project.

For data analysis and data science overall, Pandas is the most commonly used package or library to perform these operations, along with NumPy . Reading in data To get started with Pandas import: import pandas as pd import numpy as np Loading data from a .csv file df - dataframe df = pd . read_csv ( 'your_file.csv' ) # or if required to edit headers for example df = pd . read_csv ( 'your_file.csv' , header =... , na_values =... , sep =... , etc ) Loading data from an Excel file .xlsx df = pd . read_excel ( 'your_file.xlsx' ) Loading data from a SQL table/database import pyodbc import pandas as pd connection_object = pyodbc . connect ( \"Driver={SQL Server};\" \"Server=xxxx;\" \"Database=xxxx;\" \"Trusted_Connection=yes;\" ) df = pd . read_sql ( insert_your_sql_query , connection_object ) Add your Server address and Database name in the respective conditions above. Loading data from an SPSS file (.sav) There are two way to import a .sav file. One way: import pandas as pd df = pd . read_spss ( file_path , convert_categoricals = False ) or import pyreadstat df , metadata = pyreadstat . read_sav ( file_path ) The second option creates the dataframe but also captures the metadata of the .sav file, which is useful when running data validation checks. Common Operations There are many ways to perform various operations in Python, depending on the library you are using or the general approach and design you've opted to apply to your code. This guide presents several examples on how to perform common SAS operations using pandas, any suggestions or feedback is welcome. Cases You will soon notice after importing your data from the .sav file that the column headers are not aligned consistently to upper case or lower case, but a mixture of this. To apply lower or upper case to all column headers: df . columns = df . columns . str . lower () # or df . columns = df . columns . str . upper () Extracting the required columns To select a column: # columns to keep to_keep = [ \"column 1\" , \"column 2\" , \"column 3\" , ... ] # create the new table filtered_df = df [ to_keep ] Filter where a variable is not null/missing To filter rows based on some specific criteria: # not null new_df = df [ df [ \"my_column\" ] . notnull ()] Joins # a left join, one column to join on joined_df = df . merge ( other_df , how = \"left\" , on = \"my_column\" ) # inner join, on multiple columns joined_df = df . merge ( other_df , how = \"inner\" , on = [ \"column 1\" , \"column 2\" ]) Add a new column # create new table with a new column that adds 5 to each value of another selected column new_df = df . assign ( new_column = df [ \"my column\" ] + 5 ) Sorting variables # ascending order can be False or True df . sort_values ( by = \"my column\" , ascending = False ) # if you want to see missing values first, assign na_position df . sort_values ( by = \"my column\" , ascending = False , na_position = \"first\" ) # sort by multiple columns df . sort_values ( by = [ \"my column 1\" , \"my column 2\" , ... ]) Transposing columns There's a few ways to transpose columns: # set the index of columns df . set_index ([ \"my column 1\" , \"my column 2\" , \"my column 3\" , ... ], inplace = True ) # using pandas transpose to transpose rows with columns and vice versa df_transposed = df . T # using pandas stack() to transpose non-index columns into a single new column df = df . stack () . reset_index () To set the name of the axis for the index or columns you can use rename_axis() : df = df . stack () . rename_axis () . reset_index () Grouping by variables # group by one column new_df = df . groupby ( \"my_column\" ) # group by multiple columns # list of columns to group by grouped = [ \"column 1\" , \"column 2\" , \"column 3\" , ... ]] # return new table with grouped columns new_df = df . groupby ( grouped ) Aggregations Once we've done the groupings above, add the aggregations: new_df = df . groupby ( grouped ) . agg ( total_sum = ( \"column to be summarised\" , \"sum\" ), total_count = ( \"column to be counted\" , \"count\" )) . reset_index () Creating totals per row and per column # total per column, adds a new row \"Column Total\" # this will sum all numeric row values for each column df . loc [ \"Column Total\" ] = df . sum ( numeric_only = True , axis = 0 ) # total per row, creates a new column \"Row Total\" # this will sum all numeric column values for each row df . loc [:, \"Row Total\" ] = df . sum ( numeric_only = True , axis = 1 ) Appending totals to a table When creating different aggregations/groupings which are saved in different dataframes, you can then combine these aggregations into one table. For example, suppose you have calculated the totals for age and gender in different dataframes and you wish to append these results to the final output dataframe. # list the final output dataframe to store its aggregations list_df = [ df ] # append the calculated totals list_df . append ( calc_totals_df ) # concatenate into a single dataframe output_df = pd . concat ( list_df , axis = 0 ) Creating derivations To create a derivation based on the equivalent CASE WHEN SQL operation, there are several ways to do this in python: # pandas package CASE WHEN # create the age 11 to 15 derivation df . loc [ df [ \"age\" ] < 0 , \"age11_15\" ] = df [ \"age\" ] df . loc [( df [ \"age\" ] > 0 ) & ( df [ \"age\" ] < 11 ), \"age11_15\" ] = 11 df . loc [( df [ \"age\" ] > 10 ) & ( df [ \"age\" ] < 16 ), \"age11_15\" ] = df [ \"age\" ] df . loc [ df [ \"age\" ] > 14 , \"age11_15\" ] = 15 This results in creating a new column \"age11_15\" in the existing dataframe, based on the CASE WHEN conditions we applied for the new derivation. # NumPy package CASE WHEN # create the age 11 to 15 derivation age11_15 = np . select ( [ df [ 'age' ] == 10 , # WHEN df [ 'age' ] > 15 # WHEN ], [ 11 , # if age == 10 then assign 11 15 # if age > 15 assign 15 ], default = df [ 'age' ] # ELSE assign \"age\" column values ) # assign the result to a new column df [ \"age11_15\" ] = age11_15 In the first bracket you assign the \"WHEN\" part of the condition, second bracket the \"THEN\", and \"default=...\" represents the \"ELSE\" part. The NumPy option is faster and more efficient whereas Pandas is user friendlier and straightforward in its application.

For example: You change a date in your code to create a report for a different time period You produce different reports with the same pipeline (e.g., monthly and weekly reports), and depending on which report you're creating, you run different queries or functions You're doing machine learning and you have some parameters that you adjust and tweak You comment out some sections of code for a test run, but uncomment when running it \u201cfor real\u201d. What's the best way to deal with this? Generally, you should avoid situations where you need to go into your files and modify your code to change parameters. A better approach is to replace these values with variables, and define all of them in one place \u2013 a config file. Your control panel Your config file is a bit like the control panel on a machine. To change how a machine works, you shouldn't have to open it up and fiddle with the circuits and machinery inside. You should be able to do all that from the control panel. Same goes for your code. If you need to change how your pipeline runs, you shouldn't need to edit your actual code to do that \u2013 you should be able to do this from the config. This brings many advantages: Saves time : Having all your parameters in one place makes it quicker and easier to set them Reduces risk of error : It minimises the number of places that manual changes need to be made Increases reusability : Parameterised code is easier to re-use in other projects Auditability : You can export your config settings to a table or file, so you know how any particular set of results was obtained Reproducibility : By saving your config settings, you make it easy to reproduce previous results How to implement a config file in your project So that's the \u201cWhat\u201d and \u201cWhy\u201d of config files - now let's move on to the \u201cHow\u201d. Below we'll give a few steps you can follow to implement a config file in an existing Python project. 1) Identify your parameters First, think about which parts of your pipeline you want to parameterise. Any bit of your code that you have to edit manually to get a particular set of data, is a candidate for parameterisation. Don't worry about creating a full and perfect list right now. If you manage to catch 'em all, that's great, but you can always add more later if needed. 2) Create your config file There are different formats you can use for your config file, but they all boil down to a list of key-value pairs. We recommend .toml files because: They allow comments The syntax is clean and easy to work with The syntax is similar (though not identical) to Python so it's an easier learning curve But, there are other formats: XML, YAML, JSON, etc. They each have their advantages and disadvantages, but toml will do nicely for our purposes. So, make yourself a config.toml file in the root folder of your pipeline. 3) Add your parameters to the config file Add the parameters you identified in Step 1 to your config file, and give them appropriate and descriptive variable names. As noted above, the syntax is similar to python: report_type = 'monthly' period_end_date = '2025-12-25' max_records = 1000 You can see an example of a config.toml file in our Example Pipeline config file 4) Import your config parameters Somewhere in your code, you need to import the parameters in your config file into a python dictionary. To do that, you can use the toml library . The toml library does not come pre-packaged with Python, so you'll need to install it into your virtual environment, and add it to your requirements.txt file. If that last sentence was confusing, check out our guide on virtual environments . To import the toml library, just use the following in the file you want to load your config parameters into: import toml Then you can load your parameters into a python dictionary like this: config = toml . load ( 'config.toml' ) You'll need to replace the 'config.toml' bit with the path to your config file. This example assumes that the config.toml and the file you're putting this code into are in the same folder. Usually you'd import your config into the entry point of your pipeline, which will probably be called create_publication.py , pipeline.py , main.py , or something similar. 5) Pass the parameters where they are needed Once you've done that, just pass your config parameters to whatever functions need them, for example: df_hes_data = reading_data . load_csv_into_spark_data_frame ( spark , config [ 'path_to_downloaded_data' ] ) If a function requires more than one parameter from the config, you can reduce the number of function parameters by just passing the whole config dictionary to the function. For example, instead of this: df_patients_by_region = get_patient_count ( config [ 'region' ], config [ 'start_date' ], config [ 'end_date' ], config [ 'report_type' ] ) You could do this: df_patients_by_region = get_patient_count ( config ) 6) Replace hard-coded values with the parameters in the config OK, so you've created your config file, you've defined your parameters, you've imported them into your project, and you've passed them to the functions where they are needed. The final step is to integrate these parameters into your code. Replacing hard-coded values Replace any hard-coded parameter values that appear in your code with the equivalent variable from your config. So: df_patient_data [ 'in_sample' ] = np . where ( df_patient_data [ 'ccg' ] . isin ([ '07L' , '07M' , '07N' ]) . all ( axis = 1 ), 1 , None ) ...becomes: df_patient_data [ 'in_sample' ] = np . where ( df_patient_data [ 'ccg' ] . isin ([ config [ 'region_list' ]) . all ( axis = 1 ), 1 , None ) Now if you want to change the regions you're filtering by, you can just update the values in your config.toml file - you don't need to edit your code at all. Changing functionality If you have different bits of code that you want to run/not run depending on your config settings, just wrap those bits into functions, and use an if statement to determine which function to run. For example: if config [ 'report_type' ] == 'weekly' : df_report_data = get_weekly_data ( config ) elif config [ 'report_type' ] == 'monthly' : df_report_data = get_monthly_data ( config ) Over to you As you were reading through this, did any ideas pop into your head about your own projects? Any values you keep having (or forgetting!) to change? Any bits of code you sometimes need to comment out? If so, you've got a prime candidate for using a config file! So give it a try - implement the above steps in your project and see what you think.

Data classes are a special type of class that are useful for passing parameters around a pipeline Introduction This is a brief guide into the what, why and how of 'data classes' - which are a special type of classes in Python. The page provides a high-level overview of classes, aiming to serve as a jumping-off point rather than replicating the vast quantities of documentation about classes on the internet. The primary focus is on data classes and how they can benefit Reproducible Analytical Pipelines. What is a class? A class is essentially a reusable template for storing data and code which acts upon that data. Consider what happens when we call a Python function: usually it will take some input data, do something with that data and possibly return some output. In general, a function forgets what happens between each call, so if we called it again with the same arguments we'd get the same result, again and again. Classes are slightly different - there are two principal concepts: The state of a class represents the data it stores - for example, a class representing a 'person' might have 'name', 'date_of_birth' and 'address' stored within its state The methods of a class contain code that use and modify the state of a class. See this page for a tutorial to help with getting started with classes in Python. Why should I care about classes? Classes are a convenient way to program when you need to keep track of state information. It is perfectly fine not to use them and indeed for many scenarios they can unnecessarily increase complexity and contribute towards spaghetti code ! But when you find yourself passing the same data around the same set of functions again and again, then classes might help to reduce duplication and avoid repetition. What is a 'data class'? A data class is a special type of class in Python. As the name suggests, data classes are typically used as containers for passing data around different parts of a pipeline or program - they don't usually have much logic defined in methods, rather they are used to pass data between functions. (Note that here the term \"data\" is used in a broad sense, which refers not only to tabular data that you read in from a database or file, but also any value, parameter, or variable that you might need to put in your code.) In a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline, we usually have some parameters that need to be passed together to different parts of the pipeline, such as the start and end dates for a publication. If our functions for field definitions, creating tables, etc, all need to access these parameters, one way would be to have the same parameters provided multiple times in function arguments: from datetime import date def my_first_function ( start_date : date , end_date : date ): # some interesting logic def my_second_function ( start_date : date , end_date : date ): # some other interesting logic (You may notice that this example makes use of type hints, which are incredibly useful and necessary for explaining and using data classes. However, for brevity, type hints will not be covered in depth here - for more information, read this .) For a small number of parameters, and a small number of functions, this is probably fine. But imagine what this starts to look like as the number of parameters increases, as does the number of functions - there starts to be lots of repeated code, which is harder to read, more cumbersome to maintain and more prone to errors! Example: using data classes to store parameters With data classes, we can rewrite the above as follow: import dataclasses from datetime import date @dataclasses . dataclass class PublicationDates : start_date : date end_date : date def my_first_function ( publication_dates : PublicationDates ): # some interesting logic # access the start_date attribute via `publication_dates.start_date` # access the end_date attribute via `publication_dates.end_date` def my_second_function ( publication_dates : PublicationDates ): # some other interesting logic # access the start_date attribute via `publication_dates.start_date` # access the end_date attribute via ` publication_dates.end_date` Notice now that instead of two arguments, we have one - just the PublicationDates data class. Someone who wanted to use these functions could then do so as follows: start_date = date ( 2023 , 1 , 1 ) end_date = date ( 2024 , 1 , 1 ) my_publication_dates = PublicationDates ( start_date , end_date ) my_first_result = my_first_function ( my_publication_dates ) my_second_result = my_second_function ( my_publication_dates ) Although the benefits may be limited for this contrived example, we can see that: The intent is clearer when we read our function - rather than just having independent parameters called start_date and end_date we immediately know that these variables are a pair, representing the publication start and end dates, since they are contained together within the data class. Since my_publication_dates is passed to both functions, we now have a single argument for each function, so the code is easier to read and there is less room for error (e.g. it's not possible to mix up our start_date and end_date ). This doesn't make a huge difference in this example with two functions and two parameters, but imagine what happens as the pipeline grows in size and complexity! Validations using data classes A useful feature of data classes is that after they are created, a special method called __postinit__ is called: you can use this to do things like run validations or checks, or to derive additional attributes for the data class. For example: import dataclasses from datetime import date @dataclasses . dataclass class PublicationDates : start_date : date end_date : date def __postinit__ ( self ): # Raise an error if start date less than end date assert self . start_date < self . end_date , \"Start date was not less than end date!\" good_publication_dates = PublicationDates ( start_date = date ( 2022 , 1 , 1 ), end_date = date ( 2023 , 1 , 1 )) # This will be fine bad_publication_dates = PublicationDates ( start_date = date ( 2023 , 1 , 1 ), end_date = date ( 2022 , 1 , 1 )) # This will raise an AssertionError So now, in addition to the benefits we had previously, we can also have checks and validations running at the time that we define our parameters. This saves us adding these individually within each function or creating another function to do these checks that we need to remember to call! Instead, the checking/validation logic is built into how the parameters are defined! This also makes it clearer to someone who wants to use these parameters that there are constraints on the values. You don't have to define a __postinit__ method but it can be useful in certain situations. Open-source validation libraries For more advanced use-cases, there are open-source libraries of validations which build on the idea of data classes - one widely used example is Pydantic which is definitely worth exploring once you've understood the concepts introduced in this guide!

Why should I care? The key strengths of pathlib include: Simplicity : pathlib objects are easy to create, extend and reuse Functionality : pathlib offers functionality that storing paths inside strings does not, including Getting file names and stems (aka names without extensions) Getting the names of parent folders Accessing the name of the current working directory Listing the contents of nested folders Reusability : pathlib is OS-agnostic, meaning code will work with both Windows and Linux filesystems How do I use it? The steps below show briefly how to make use of pathlib. This is by no means an exhaustive walkthrough for everything you can do with pathlib - for more information, see the pathlib-docs . Getting started Import pathlib or pathlib2 (the python-2 backwards compatible version) import pathlib In pathlib, pathlib.Path objects are the key components. You can define Path objects and access attributes / methods to perform a wide variety of operations For example, you can access the current working directory with the cwd attribute. # Print the current working directory (cwd) print ( \"CWD:\" , pathlib . Path . cwd ()) Pass strings to Path constructor to create a Path object # . is the current directory cwd_path = pathlib . Path ( \".\" ) print ( \"CWD (again):\" , cwd_path ) # Use resolve to get the absolute path! cwd_abspath = cwd_path . resolve () print ( \"Absolute CWD:\" , cwd_abspath ) Path attributes The following examples show how pathlib makes it easier to extract specific attributes of a path. Example: absolute path to the current file # Note: __file__ is a global Python variable this_file_path = pathlib . Path ( __file__ ) print ( \"Path to file:\" , this_file_path ) Example: get the file name print ( \"File name:\" , this_file_path . name ) Example: get the file name without extension (aka the stem) print ( \"File stem:\" , this_file_path . stem ) Example: get the parent directory print ( \"Parent folder:\" , this_file_path . parent ) To see all the options (there are many!) use help(pathlib.Path) or see the pathlib-docs .

Python is an open-source programming language famous for its ease of use. It has a simple syntax, which is easier to learn and read than most languages. It's also considered a 'high-level' language - this means you can get on with making code do what you want it to without worrying about overly technical aspects like assigning chunks of memory. This also has downsides; Python can run slower than other languages. Broadly, Python is considered the language of choice for data science, with a growing collection of helpful packages and is a popular choice for the kinds of scripting and automation which we need to do when building Reproducable Analytical Pipelines. Programming Environment You'll need to have somewhere to work where you can run Python code to follow this guide. GitHub codespaces or Google Collab can be a nice tools to get started, however cannot be used for all of your work. It's a good idea to go over the RAP readiness - resources guide to understand what you need (and might be missing) for RAP! Getting Started You can write Python code in any program that allows you to write plain text. However, this is like running a marathon without any shoes on, uncomfortable and you are likely to run into some issues. Therefore we recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs are programs that make developing code much easier by providing a feature-rich toolset with tools such as: Editors Run-time environments Line numbering Variable Training Debugging tools Interpreters Auto-correction and suggestion Whether you're new to coding or an old hand, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode). This has a few benefits: it's feature-rich, lightweight, and works the same across multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux). It's also already installed on most NHS environments where you might want to write code. Other IDE's are available, such as Spyder, Eclipse, PyCharm, Sublime, Atom, and more! Some of our analytical environments use Databricks , in which you can write and execute Python code. Python In VSCode Once you've installed and opened VSCode, you'll want to install the Python extension for VSCode. You can find the Extensions panel either by clicking the link above, or by pressing ctrl + shift + x . From here you can search for and install the Python extension. If you're familiar with working with Jupyter Notebooks, you can also download the Jupyter extension in the same way. Hello World Now we want to use Python to run a simple script. Create a file called hello_python.py (in VSCode, you can just press Ctrl + N to make a file). In this new file, write print(\"Hello World\") This is all the code we need to test our Python install. There's a couple of ways you can run this code: In VSCode, press Ctrl + Shift + p . This will bring up the Command Palette. You can do most things from here - try typing something which you're trying to do, and there's likely a command which will appear. In our case, we want to run the file, so we type run file and select the appropriate option - run file in Terminal . As the screenshot shows, we can also run the file by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Enter . Alternatively, we can run the same file from outside VSCode. Open a terminal and navigate to the space where you've written your script, then run the command: python -m hello_python.py Whichever method you use, you ought to see Hello World printed to the terminal. Environments and Packages It's considered good practice to create a virtual environment for each of your Python projects - we explain why on this page . There are many tools which you can use to create and manage your Python environments; we recommend reading our guide to conda and our guide to venv and picking one of these two. Data Analysis in Python Many consider Python to be the language of choice for data analysis. One of the things which makes Python powerful is the wide range of packages and tools available for the language -- this makes it flexible enough to be useful for small-scale analysis, which happens directly on your laptop and for larger projects which use cloud resources. To get started with analysis, take a look at our guide to basic Python data analysis operations . If you're using Databricks or otherwise working with large datasets and distributed computing, take a look at the documentation we have on Pyspark in the sidebar. You can start with our page on what it is SQL and Python Whatever the scale of your data, you might need to interact with it via SQL queries. You can generate these using Python too - check out our guide on how to to so . Writing Python Code There are as many opinions about what constitutes good code as there are coders. It's also always a good idea to adhere to a style guide. For Python, we recommend using PEP-8 , which is also mentioned in our Levels of RAP more specifically, the Google Python style-guide (which is also the core of our Pyspark style guide ) There are tools called linters which can be used to check for these styles automatically, such as Pylint Next, you'll want to know how to structure your Python projects , how to write good functions , and how to approach unit testing in Python . Where Now? You've now you've got Python installed and you've got an editor to work in. There's lots and lots of training resources about how to write Python code, here are some we've found useful: Python in an hour : this notebook was presented in a workshop at the Health and Care Analytics conference 2024. It's designed to give you a gentle introduction to Python and some of the things it can do, in just an hour.

These big topics could each be given their own chapter but here we try to show how the combination of simple logging and simple error handling can be easy to implement while offering substantial benefits. What is logging? Logging is a way to track events that occur when your code runs. The logs will show when different parts of your code was run and what the result was. For example, my ingest_data.py module ran at 08:44 on 2021-09-17 and found 3,452,521 rows of data. You can think of logging as the next evolution of the print statement. When writing code interactively, we use print statements to understand what is happening at each step. By replacing these print statements with logs, we are able to permanently track what is happening in these interesting parts of the code. Python\u2019s standard library \" logging \" includes a flexible built-in logging module, allowing the developer to create different configurations to fulfil their logging needs. For example, the log can be categorised based on levels of severity and the users might select the destination (in console, files, remote server, or email). What is error handling? Error handling provides a way for us to try to handle problems in our code in a constructive manner. Error handling works hand-in-hand with logging to improve code reliability. When our code fails for some reason, we usually see an error message on screen and the running of the code stops. That error message is known as an exception. Exceptions are objects which represent errors which contain information about the kind of error and where it was caused. As a developer, I can often anticipate what parts of my code are likely to have errors. For example, parsing a .csv file where we expect a certain list of column headers. By using error handling at these points in the code, I can make the code fail gracefully while writing an informative error message to my logs. In this way we improve visibility of the functioning of our code. If the code runs every night at midnight but has failed last night, then our error handling and logging should tell me exactly what has gone wrong. Logging in Python Python comes with a standard \" logging \" library that gives us the capabilities to: Diagnose an issue during development or debug bigger problem Track what is going on in the system for better monitoring Control what output is created and how it looks You can read the official Python logging tutorial for instructions on how to customise and adapt the logger. As a basic example - here is the code to set up a logger: import logging logging . basicConfig ( level = logging . INFO , format = ' %(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s ' , handlers = [ logging . FileHandler ( f \"./reports/logs/ { time . strftime ( '%Y-%m- %d _%H-%M-%S' ) } .log\" ), logging . StreamHandler ( sys . stdout ) ] ) logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) The format argument describes how we want our log to look. Here we include the time, the name of the file that is running, and a custom message that we will specify when we use the logger. The handlers argument sets up two outputs for the log - one copy of the log info will be written to a file (the FileHandler) and another copy will be printed on screen (just like a print statement). We can then use the logger to keep track of what is happening in the code by passing in informative messages: logger . info ( \"Step 1: Import all the input data from MSSQL database\" ) The resulting logs might look something like this: 2021-08-02 15:43:13 - __main__ - INFO - Step 1: Import all the input data from MSSQL database 2021-08-02 15:43:14 - diabetes.utilities.processing_steps - INFO - Read and prepare input data 2021-08-02 15:43:15 - diabetes.utilities.data_connections - INFO - Loading 100 rows from dev.NDA_DEMO_E3_202021... 2021-08-02 15:43:16 - diabetes.utilities.data_connections - INFO - Loading 100 rows from dev.NDA_BMI_E3_202021_... You can see that the information we described in the format argument is captured here. We could go further and include additional useful info: Filename where the log was triggered ( filename ) Function name where the log was triggered ( funcName ) Line number where the log was triggered ( lineno ) Process ID of the process where the log happened ( processName ) You can find a full list of things to add in the docs . Video tutorial: Logging demo Internal to NHS England This video can be found internal to NHS England within the RAP community of practice MS Teams page under: Files > COP video tutorials > Error Handling Error handling in Python Error handling using try/except is useful and powerful. When Python hits an error, it produces something called an exception. An exception is an object that tries can tell you something about what has gone wrong. There are many different types of exceptions - see the full list here . To get started with error handling however, the simplest way is to start with a block of code like below: input = 'some text' try : int ( input ) logger . info ( 'input converted to integer' ) except ValueError as e : logger . exception ( f 'Could not convert { input } to integer. Got error message: \\n\\n { repr ( e ) } ' ) Here we try to run our code and write a message to the log if it works. If the code fails then an exception will be raised - and our code writes that exception to the log so we can examine it later. The important thing is that by combining simple logging with simple error handling, you have really substantially improved the ease with which your code can be run and monitored. You have identified a part of the code where something is likely to go wrong and you have added some guard rails. This is bad practice as instead of handling the specific errors the code could throw out we instead try and ignore them. Lets say our code can throw out a ValueError , a ZeroDivisionError , and a KeyError . Instead of catching a general Exception which provides no control over how each of the exceptions are handled we should instead do the following: try : # Some problematic code that could raise different kinds of exceptions except ValueError as e : print ( 'Found a value error!' ) print ( repr ( e )) exit () except ZeroDivisionError as e : print ( 'Found a division by zero error!' ) print ( repr ( e )) exit () except KeyError as e : print ( 'Found a key error!' ) print ( repr ( e )) exit () Alternatively if we really did want to handle all of those exceptions in the same way we should still not use the generic Exception class. The reason for this is that if someone reads our code it is very unclear what kinds of errors the code can create, it is better to list all the errors as a tuple to provide a form of documentation like so: try : # Some problematic code that could raise different kinds of exceptions except ( ValueError , ZeroDivisionError , KeyError ) as e : print ( 'Found an error!' ) print ( repr ( e )) exit () Error handling dos and don'ts Don't raise a generic exception Raising a generic exception is bad practice: raise Exception ( 'Error I encountered' ) The problem with raising a generic exception like this is that it is difficult to catch correctly. For example: a = 1 b = 0 try : a / b raise Exception ( 'Error I encountered' ) except Exception as e : print ( 'Caught error with message: ' + repr ( e )) While we would expect our code to catch our raised exception and print 'Caught error with message: Error I encountered', it would actually instead print that it encountered a ZeroDivisionError . The reason for this is that ZeroDivisionError is a sub/child class of Exception , it is encountered first so is caught first. There is also a flip-side to this which causes another issue when raising a generic Exception : try : raise Exception ( 'Error I encountered' ) except ValueError : exit () While child classes of Exception are caught by an except block which catches errors of type Exception the same is not true the other way around. The raised Exception will not be caught by the except block here as it is not of type ValueError . As a general rule of thumb avoid using the generic Exception class at all. It is often tempting to write code like this: try : # Some problematic code that could raise different kinds of exceptions except Exception : print ( 'Found an error!' ) exit () Don't lose the stack trace The stack trace (a log of where the error occurred and how it occurred), is incredibly important and is one of the most useful features of exception objects. When an exception is created it has a stack trace. For example: def a (): return b () def b (): c () def c (): raise Exception ( 'Don \\' t call me!' ) a () The code above will obviously raise an exception. That exception will contain within it a stack trace showing that an exception was raised by function c , but it will also show the steps leading up to that: Exception <- c <- b <- a <- a() . This is very useful for debugging. There are cases when writing try/except statements where we want to catch an exception, log some message, and then raise the exception again. For example we may have a function that could create a ZeroDivisionError , inside that function we use a try/except to catch the exception and log a message about it. However, we don't want the function to return any value as the division failed, so instead we want to raise the exception again so that the code that called the function knows it failed: def divide_two_numbers ( a : float , b : float ) -> float : try : return a / b except ZeroDivisionError as e : print ( 'Division failed because of: ' + repr ( e )) raise ZeroDivisionError # In use: a = 1.0 b = 0 try : result = divide_two_numbers ( a , b ) except ZeroDivisionError : print ( 'Division failed can \\' t continue' ) exit () This is wrong . The specific place this is wrong is here: raise ZeroDivisionError Doing this raises a new ZeroDivisionError, which loses the stack trace of the original raised exception. Instead to re-raise the exception do the following: except ZeroDivisionError : # Do stuff raise Don't let the program continue if it can't It is a common mistake to view try/catch statements as a way of 'fixing' or avoiding an error. However, often an exception does signal that the program needs to terminate. The pseudocode below is an example of a common mistake pattern: my_file = None try : my_file = open_file ( path_to_my_file ) except : print ( 'Couldn \\' t find the file!' ) print ( my_file . contents ()) This is a common case where just because an exception has been caught, that doesn't mean the error has been handled. The potential error is the file not being found, the try/catch acknowledges this but then the program moves on as if nothing has happened. This means that inevitably the final print statement will produce another error as it tries to use a None value. Instead the following should have been done: my_file = None try : my_file = open_file ( path_to_my_file ) except : print ( 'Couldn \\' t find the file!' ) exit () print ( my_file . contents ()) This is a very basic example but this topic is well covered by the official Python error handling tutorial and so you can look there for an in-depth summary. There is a balance to be found in applying both logging and error handling. For most code you don't need or want everything wrapped up like this - it becomes messy.

There is guidance on how to adapt the RAP Package template for your project Why should we care? If we use a standard repo structure it will be easier for other people to understand and reuse your code. This structure follows current best practice for Python Packaging your code makes it easier for other people to re-run it, or use the functions / classes / etc. that you've made. Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note Levels of RAP Essential Having well organised code and following a standard directory format is a component of Silver RAP A Python package is a way to bundle your code into a single thing that can be shared and reused. If our goal is to be able to share and reuse code across NHS England and externally then there are many benefits to packaging code: Shareable : The most important reason to use packages is that it is the way to share Python code. Not using packages runs the risk that other people will not be able to run your code... \"It works fine on my machine\". Databricks : It looks likely that packaging code will be the easiest way to get your code onto databricks. (NB: we are keeping a close eye on Data Refinery to answer this question) Reliability : Packages go a long way to ensuring that other people in your team can open your code and run it without hitting issues. Organised : Packages allow you to organise your code in logical sections. This makes it much easier to test and to maintain over time. Predictable : since all packages follow a similar structure, other analysts will be able to quickly understand how you have organised your code. No more hunting through a random directory structure trying to figure out where everything is kept. This is a tricky topic at first so we recommend asking for some support when you set this up for the first time. How to package Python code In order to package your code, you just need to follow the standard templates for Python projects. I describe this briefly here but provide links to the comprehensive official guidance below. Here is an outline of a very basic Python project for a publication as an example: project_name \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/ | \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py | \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 example_package/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 example.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 sql/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 templates/ \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests/ Note that the whole directory is called project_name but we also have a sub-folder called src . All of our code lives inside this src sub-folder. Sometimes you might see the folder that contains all the code called scripts but the other common convention is to name it the same as the overall project. The README.md file is extremely important as this functions as the package\u2019s landing page. The README provides a bird's eye view of the whole package. You should treat it as the first thing a new starter might read when trying to understand your code. It might contain an overview of the code, details of inputs/outputs, how to install package, ownership, contributing and licence info. The random-seeming files ( pyproject.toml , requirements.txt , etc.) are all involved in dependency management. Your package will depend on certain things being in place in order to run - these files manage those dependencies. Be aware that dependency management has evolved over the years in Python and other languages and best practice has changed over time. Here, we aim to keep it as simple as possible while still achieving the goal of producing robust, shareable code. Also note the funny looking __init__.py . This file tells Python that this code is part of a package. With this file in place you can import functions from the different parts of your code. E.g. from sdd.example_package.example import my_function . Again - you can learn more about this in the links below. Here is another for the NDA publication so you can see the pattern. We have a more elaborate version of this below. national-diabetes-audit/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 diabetes_code/ | \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py | \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 example_package/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 example.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests/ Generic package template To help get you started, we have created a generic package structure that you can adapt for your own purposes. The repository is stored on GitHub . You can fork this repo and use it as a starting point for your own package. So what now? Make your own package either by adding the files yourself or by cloning the generic template that we provide. Once you have the package structure in place, you can install that package on your machine following any of these options: Never used virtual environments before? Visit our RAP COP guidance ! Using pip python -m venv .venv .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 python -m pip install -r requirements.txt For Visual Studio Code it is necessary that you change your default interpreter to the virtual environment you just created .venv. To do this use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-P, search for Python: Select interpreter and select .venv from the list. Using conda The first line of the environment.yml file sets the new environment's name. In this template, the name is rap_template - you should change this in the environment.yml file, as well as the following code, to the name of your project. conda env create -f environment.yml conda activate <environment_name> Once the package is installed it will be able to identify all the modules inside your code. If you have populated the setup.py and requirements.txt , Python will install all of the bits that your code needs in order to run. More importantly, other people can install finished your package from gitlab using pip install git+path_to_my_repo . For example pip install git+https://<domain>/<path>/diabetes_rap Even better, you can bundle all of your code into a single file called a wheel (.whl). This wheel can be shared, stored in an online repository for others to use, or installed into data processing platforms such as Databricks. Adapting package structure for analytical work Every Python project should follow the standard package structure to help ensure portability and reliability. Nevertheless, there is scope to adapt this structure to fit the workflow of specific projects. The cookie cutter data science template shows how you can include folders for output data, validation reports, figures, etc. The figure below shows how we have applied this structure to the RAP package template . project_name | .gitignore <- Files (& file types) automatically removed from version control for security purposes | config.toml <- Configuration file with parameters we want to be able to change (e.g. date) | environment.yml <- Conda equivalent of requirements file | requirements.txt <- Requirements for reproducing the analysis environment | pyproject.toml <- Configuration file containing package build information | LICENCE <- License info for public distribution | README.md <- Quick start guide / explanation of your project | | create_publication.py <- Runs the overall pipeline to produce the publication | +---src <- Scripts with functions for use in 'create_publication.py'.

Everything else at the top level has to do with packaging and testing the code. In the repository there are two files: create_publication.py and config.toml . These top level files are the highest level of abstraction and should be the main place where users interact with the code. The config.toml file contains all of the parameters that we expect to change frequently, e.g. input data. The create_publication.py file organises the steps in a simple, easy-to-understand manner that should be readable by anyone, even if they don't know python. In this way, we aim to reduce risk by make the code accessible to new staff. The requirements.txt file which specifies all the Python packages you wish to install. See venv virtual environments guide . The environment.yml is Conda offering a way to export and share environments via a yaml file. See Conda virtual environments guide for more info. The pyproject.toml file, which contains build system requirements and information, which are used by pip to build the package. For more information see pyproject.toml documentation . root In the highest level of this repository (known as the 'root'), there is one Python file: create_publication.py . This top level file should be the main place where users interact with the code, where you store the steps to create your publication. This file currently runs a set of example steps using example data. src This directory contains the meaty parts of the code. By organising the code into logical sections, we make it easier to understand, maintain and test. Moreover, tucking the complex code out of the way means that users don't need to understand everything about the code all at once. data_connections.py handles reading data in and writing data back out. processing folder contains the core business logic. utils folder contains useful reusable functions (e.g. to set up logging, and importing configuration settings from config.toml ) write_excel.py contains functions relating to the final part of the pipeline, any exporting or templating happens here. This is a simplistic application of writing output code to an Excel spreadsheet template (.xlsx). A good example of this application is: NHS sickness absence rates publication . We highly recommend to use Automated Excel Production for a more in depth Excel template production application. Note that we never store passwords or any sensitive credentials in the repo to prevent the situation where it can mistakenly committed into the git. There are several ways to deal with the secret, keys and passwords such as using Git Hooks or final cleansing process before publishing.

Pre-requisites Pre-requisite Importance Note Levels of RAP Essential Having well organised code and following a standard directory format is a component of Silver RAP A Python package is a way to bundle your code into a single thing that can be shared and reused. If our goal is to be able to share and reuse code across NHS England and externally then there are many benefits to packaging code: Shareable : The most important reason to use packages is that it is the way to share Python code. Not using packages runs the risk that other people will not be able to run your code... \"It works fine on my machine\". Databricks : It looks likely that packaging code will be the easiest way to get your code onto databricks. (NB: we are keeping a close eye on Data Refinery to answer this question) Reliability : Packages go a long way to ensuring that other people in your team can open your code and run it without hitting issues. Organised : Packages allow you to organise your code in logical sections. This makes it much easier to test and to maintain over time. Predictable : since all packages follow a similar structure, other analysts will be able to quickly understand how you have organised your code. No more hunting through a random directory structure trying to figure out where everything is kept.

All of our code lives inside this src sub-folder. Sometimes you might see the folder that contains all the code called scripts but the other common convention is to name it the same as the overall project. The README.md file is extremely important as this functions as the package\u2019s landing page. The README provides a bird's eye view of the whole package. You should treat it as the first thing a new starter might read when trying to understand your code. It might contain an overview of the code, details of inputs/outputs, how to install package, ownership, contributing and licence info.

A function is a block of organised code that is reusable, and is used to perform a single defined action. Functions can take in multiple values (arguments) and can also return a value after executing. The code of the function only runs when it is called. Features of a function In Python, the standard library provides many useful built-in function such as len(), print(), str(), int(), however the programmer can define their own function to suit their particular needs and requirements. Python functions are defined by using the def keyword. Here is an example of a Python function which converts the argument temp which is a value representing a temperature in Fahrenheit, into Celsius: # Define the function def fahrenheit_to_celsius ( temp ): new_temp = ( temp - 32 ) * ( 5 / 9 ) return new_temp # Use the function fahrenheit_to_celsius ( 77 ) >>> 25.0 It's also a common convention to return a Python expression directly, instead of assigning it to a variable. In previous example, we can re-write the same function to be more concise: def fahrenheit_to_celsius ( temp ): return ( temp - 32 ) * ( 5 / 9 ) If you don't specify anything to be returned, your function will return None. In this example we can see all the features of a function: The name of the function is fahrenheit_to_celsius() (you should use snake_case here) The function has one argument temp . Function arguments in Python are listed between the parentheses after the function name. Additional function arguments are separated by commas. The code body calculates the value of the input Fahrenheit temperature in Celsius. The function returns the result of this calculation. This is done using the return keyword in python. When the program hits the return keyword it immediately returns the value specified after the keyword and exits the function. If the function doesn't return anything (which it does not need to) then the function is exited when all the code in the function body has been executed. When calling a function, you need to supply argument inputs for all parameters, otherwise, the Python interpreter will raise a TypeError. Remember to supply the arguments in the same order that the parameters are appeared so that it can be assigned correctly. Why use functions? There are several benefits to using functions, we will discuss the following here: They cut down on repetitive code by allowing you to call previously written blocks of code. They allow you to break down a process into steps making code more readable. The use of variable arguments allows functions to adapt better to changing needs. They make testing easier. They provide additional means of documentation. Re-usability Functions allow us to cut down on code repetition, which makes code harder to read and understand. In general, if you need to write the same code pattern more than twice then you should put some time into writing a function for later usage. When you need to change part of this code chunks, it will be more convenience to do it once inside a function instead of changing many places in your code base. For example, we take the following function to implement bubble sort. A sorting algorithm aims to take in an array of numbers and sort them in increasing order. The bubble sort compares each pair of adjacent elements in the input array and swaps them if they are not in the right order. def bubblesort ( arr ): n = len ( arr ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr [ j ] > arr [ j + 1 ] : arr [ j ], arr [ j + 1 ] = arr [ j + 1 ], arr [ j ] If we had three arrays we wanted to sort (arr1, arr2, arr3) and we didn't use a function we would have to repeat our code three times. This produces messy code that is hard to read. Can you spot the errors in the code below? # Sort array 1 n = len ( arr1 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr1 [ j ] > arr1 [ j + 1 ] : arr1 [ j ], arr1 [ j + 1 ] = arr1 [ j + 1 ], arr1 [ j ] # Sort array 2 n = len ( arr2 ) for i in range ( m - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr2 [ j ] > arr2 [ j + 1 ] : arr2 [ i ], arr2 [ j + 1 ] = arr2 [ j + 1 ], arr2 [ j ] # Sort array 3 n = len ( arr3 ) for j in range ( n - 1 ): for i in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr3 [ j ] > arr3 [ j + 1 ] : arr3 [ j ], arr3 [ j + 1 ] = arr3 [ j + 1 ], arr3 [ i ] Writing repetitive non-functional code is bad practice. Copy pasting processes like this and changing variable names can result in mistakes and will make a project excessively verbose. By using the defined function before, all of these issues are fixed with no functionality lost: # Sort array 1 bubblesort ( arr = arr1 ) # Sort array 2 bubblesort ( arr = arr2 ) # Sort array 3 bubblesort ( arr = arr3 ) Re-usability is not the only benefit of functions, and just because a process is only done once does not mean that it should not be placed inside the body of a function instead. In the SQL code for computing \"Cholesterol Numerator\", the code chunk below was repeated multiple times. When transforming to RAP, we define a PySpark function once and reuse the code many times. CASU_DIABETES .[ dbo ].[ fnc_suppression_rm ]( SUM ( CASE WHEN CHOLESTEROL_CP = 1 AND AGE >= 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ), 'count' ) AS [ Cholesterol Numerator ] transform to: cholesterol_numerator = ( F . when (( F . col ( 'AGE' ) >= 12 ) & ( F . col ( 'CHOL_DATE_FLAG' ) == 1 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) Breaking down a process into logical steps Using functions can better elucidate the steps of a process. A long process typically has several logical steps to it each of which can be delivered by a block of code. If we attempt to write out all the steps of the process in a long sequence of code this will be very difficult to read, and identifying the separate steps of the process is difficult. Below is an example from the diabetes RAP that uses functions, functions aren't being used here to cut down on code re-use but rather to make the steps of the delivered process more clear: # Step 3: Identify the best record for each person best_record = identify_best_record ( record_scores = record_scores ) # Step 4: Use the best record to cut down the record_scores table, creating the golden record golden_record = create_golden_record_table ( record_scores = record_scores , best_record = best_record ) # Step 5: Derive additional fields for the golden record table enriched_golden_record = enrich_golden_record ( golden_record = golden_record , hes_diabetes = hes_diabetes , imd_scores = imd_scores ) # Step 6: Output the golden record table to SQL so we can avoid recalculating next time write_df_to_SQL ( df_to_write = enriched_golden_record , target_table = golden_record_sql , mode = 'overwrite' , database = params [ 'work_db' ]) # Step 7: after attain the golden_record (either by saved table or generate new one), we build final table final_table = produce_aggregates ( golden_record ) It is important to note that overuse of functions like this can be a bad thing. Breaking down a process into too many functions will make code harder to read. An extreme example can demonstrate this: def sort_each_element ( arr , n ): for i in range ( n - 1 ): do_swaps ( arr = arr , i = i , n = n ) def do_swaps ( arr , i , n ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr [ j ] > arr [ j + 1 ]: swap ( arr = arr , j = j ) def swap ( arr , j ): arr [ j ], arr [ j + 1 ] = arr [ j + 1 ], arr [ j ] def bubblesort ( arr ): n = len ( arr ) sort_each_element ( arr , n ) This code delivers a function bubblesort which has the same functionality as the previous bubblesort example. The difference is that in this example the logical steps of a bubble sort have been broken down into far too many functions, and instead of having a positive effect the code is now harder to read as each function needs to be understood. Arguments Another benefit is that using functions allows us to adapt to new changes through the use of arguments. For example lets say in our initial bubble sort example it was decided that calling the arrays arr1 , arr2 , and arr3 was not descriptive enough. The lead on the project decides that instead these arrays should be renamed to array1 , array2 , and array3 . Without using a function we would have to change every occurrence of these variables in our long messy code: # Sort array 1 n = len ( array1 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array1 [ j ] > array1 [ j + 1 ] : array1 [ j ], array1 [ j + 1 ] = array1 [ j + 1 ], array1 [ j ] # Sort array 2 n = len ( array2 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array2 [ j ] > array2 [ j + 1 ] : array2 [ j ], array2 [ j + 1 ] = array2 [ j + 1 ], array2 [ j ] # Sort array 3 n = len ( array3 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array3 [ j ] > array3 [ j + 1 ] : array3 [ j ], array3 [ j + 1 ] = array3 [ j + 1 ], array3 [ j ] This is bad practice. It is time consuming and could also result in mistakes. If instead we used a defined function we would only have to change the name of the variable passed as an argument: # Sort array 1 bubblesort ( arr = array1 ) # Sort array 2 bubblesort ( arr = array2 ) # Sort array 3 bubblesort ( arr = array3 ) Another example could be seen in the diabetes RAP. Lets say that in step 5 we instead want to use some new_hes_diabetes data, we can simply update that one argument without having to rewrite the whole logical step of the process: # OLD Step 5: Derive additional fields for the golden record table golden_record = enrich_golden_record ( golden_record = golden_record , hes_diabetes = hes_diabetes , imd_scores = imd_scores ) # NEW Step 5: Derive additional fields for the golden record table golden_record = enrich_golden_record ( golden_record = golden_record , # change: hes_diabetes = new_hes_diabetes , imd_scores = imd_scores ) So another benefit of functions is that it makes code more maintainable and future-proofed. Without using functions a change in project requirements could mean changing hundreds of lines of code. However, if we use functions and setup our arguments correctly we can simply change what is passed to the functions in the process. Testing Another benefit of using functions is that they aid in testing the project. Functions typically deliver a small unit of functionality that the program needs, for example the program might need to be able to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. By putting this in a function we can test that function with different input values to see if it produces an expected output. If the function succeeds then we know the program has that unit of functionality; this is called unit testing. Documentation By breaking down processing steps into functions we can individually document each of these functions, whereas if we instead had a long sequence of code the best documentation that is possible are simple code comments throughout. The next section goes into detail on documenting functions and the benefits of doing so. Python docstrings make it possible to document your defined Python functions, and describe their functionality. Here is an example of a well-documented Python function: def fahrenheit_to_celsius ( temp : float ) -> float : \"\"\" Converts temperatures in Fahrenheit to Celsius. Takes the input temperature (in Fahrenheit), calculates the value of the same temperature in Celsius, and then returns this value. Args: temp: a float value representing a temperature in Fahrenheit. Returns: The input temperature converted into Celsius Example: fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp=77) >>> 25.0 \"\"\" new_temp = ( temp - 32 ) * ( 5 / 9 ) return new_temp The docstring occurs underneath the initial definition of the function. The docstring occurs between a set of two triple quotation marks ( \"\"\" ). The first thing that occurs in the docstring should be a description of what the function does when invoked, it may also contain additional documentation/notes about the design of the function, considerations that had to be made, use case of the function etc. Try and describe the function in one short line (80 characters), any other details about the function description should be written after a blank line. After the general goal of the function has been described, a section should be given to describe what each of the input arguments are, what the return value is (if there is one), and also an example use-case of the calling the function. There are several styles for docstrings, the example above uses the Google style. There are several key benefits to this kind of documentation that make it worthwhile: It allows you to return to code that you have written previously and be quickly reminded what the function does. It makes it easy for team members to understand the purpose of the function. While they can read through the code to understand the logical steps, the docstring can provide additional context and considerations. It makes it easy for new team members to come on board. Reading through many lines of code can be exhausting, reading docstrings very quickly conveys the intended functionality that the function delivers. When using an IDE with coding hints team members can quickly see a description of what the function does, which saves them from having to read through all the code of the function in order to understand what it delivers. Example: There are also some additional kinds of documentation that can be done on functions which will not be discussed here, such as type hints and annotations. Once you have multiple function in your project, you will need to organise them. This can be done by creating their own module so that the functions can be imported into other part of your code. You can also generate methods for classes, these topics are beyond the scope of this wiki for now but it is worth to learn more when you are getting used to Python language. Coding challenge Here are some questions to help you practice writing functions. Challenge 1. Multiplier We are designing a function which returns the result of multiplying 5 by 5. What is the missing keyword below to define a function: ... multiply (): In the code body we need to calculate the value of our calculation. Can you fill in the calculation: def multiply (): value = ... Currently our function only calculates this value, but we have no way of obtaining the result, fill out the last line of the function body so if we call the function we can get the result: def multiply (): value = 5 * 5 ... Our function only serves a very simply basic purpose. It would be better if our function could return the result of the multiplication of any two values. Fill in the gaps so our function now uses arguments: def multiply ( ... , ... ): value = a * b return value Our function now serves its purpose, but we may want to document it so in future other programmers can understand it. Add in a docstring with a single line describing the function: def multiply ( a , b ): ... value = a * b return value Expand on the docstring by describing its parameters: def multiply ( a , b ): \"\"\" Multiplies two values. ... \"\"\" value = a * b return value Expand on the docstring by describing the return value: def multiply ( a , b ): \"\"\" Multiplies two values. Args: a: first value in the calculation. b: second value in the calculation ... \"\"\" value = a * b return value Expand on the docstring by giving an example use of calling the function: def multiply ( a , b ): \"\"\" Multiplies two values. Args: a: first value in the calculation. b: second value in the calculation Returns: The result of multiplying a by b ... \"\"\" value = a * b return value Challenge 2. Interest Calculator The following function returns the amount of money you have after 10 years with 5% interest applied once a year with an initial amount of \u00a31000: def interest (): return math . pow ( 1000 * ( 1 + ( 0.005 / 1 )), 10 ) We can change the number of times the interest applied each year to be an argument in the function called n: def interest ( n ): return math . pow ( 1000 * ( 1 + ( 0.005 / n )), 10 ) Adapt the function by filling in the gaps to allow the interest rate (r) to be changed: def interest ( n , ... ): return math . pow ( 1000 * ( 1 + ( .../ n )), 10 ) Adapt the function to allow the years (t) to be changed: def interest ( n , ... ): return math . pow ( 1000 * ( 1 + ( 0.005 / n )), ... ) Adapt the function to allow the initial amount of money (p) to be changed: def interest ( n , ... ): return math . pow ( ... * ( 1 + ( 0.005 / n )), 10 ) Combine all these steps the define a function which calculates interest: def interest ( n , ... ): return math . pow ( ... ) External links This wiki page is focused on the use cases for functions rather than a general guide on writing Python functions.

Python functions are defined by using the def keyword. Here is an example of a Python function which converts the argument temp which is a value representing a temperature in Fahrenheit, into Celsius: # Define the function def fahrenheit_to_celsius ( temp ): new_temp = ( temp - 32 ) * ( 5 / 9 ) return new_temp # Use the function fahrenheit_to_celsius ( 77 ) >>> 25.0 It's also a common convention to return a Python expression directly, instead of assigning it to a variable. In previous example, we can re-write the same function to be more concise: def fahrenheit_to_celsius ( temp ): return ( temp - 32 ) * ( 5 / 9 ) If you don't specify anything to be returned, your function will return None. In this example we can see all the features of a function: The name of the function is fahrenheit_to_celsius() (you should use snake_case here) The function has one argument temp . Function arguments in Python are listed between the parentheses after the function name. Additional function arguments are separated by commas. The code body calculates the value of the input Fahrenheit temperature in Celsius. The function returns the result of this calculation. This is done using the return keyword in python. When the program hits the return keyword it immediately returns the value specified after the keyword and exits the function. If the function doesn't return anything (which it does not need to) then the function is exited when all the code in the function body has been executed. When calling a function, you need to supply argument inputs for all parameters, otherwise, the Python interpreter will raise a TypeError. Remember to supply the arguments in the same order that the parameters are appeared so that it can be assigned correctly.","title":"Features of a function"},{"location":"training_resources/python/python-functions/#why-use-functions","text":"There are several benefits to using functions, we will discuss the following here: They cut down on repetitive code by allowing you to call previously written blocks of code.

In general, if you need to write the same code pattern more than twice then you should put some time into writing a function for later usage. When you need to change part of this code chunks, it will be more convenience to do it once inside a function instead of changing many places in your code base. For example, we take the following function to implement bubble sort. A sorting algorithm aims to take in an array of numbers and sort them in increasing order. The bubble sort compares each pair of adjacent elements in the input array and swaps them if they are not in the right order. def bubblesort ( arr ): n = len ( arr ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr [ j ] > arr [ j + 1 ] : arr [ j ], arr [ j + 1 ] = arr [ j + 1 ], arr [ j ] If we had three arrays we wanted to sort (arr1, arr2, arr3) and we didn't use a function we would have to repeat our code three times. This produces messy code that is hard to read. Can you spot the errors in the code below? # Sort array 1 n = len ( arr1 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr1 [ j ] > arr1 [ j + 1 ] : arr1 [ j ], arr1 [ j + 1 ] = arr1 [ j + 1 ], arr1 [ j ] # Sort array 2 n = len ( arr2 ) for i in range ( m - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr2 [ j ] > arr2 [ j + 1 ] : arr2 [ i ], arr2 [ j + 1 ] = arr2 [ j + 1 ], arr2 [ j ] # Sort array 3 n = len ( arr3 ) for j in range ( n - 1 ): for i in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr3 [ j ] > arr3 [ j + 1 ] : arr3 [ j ], arr3 [ j + 1 ] = arr3 [ j + 1 ], arr3 [ i ] Writing repetitive non-functional code is bad practice. Copy pasting processes like this and changing variable names can result in mistakes and will make a project excessively verbose. By using the defined function before, all of these issues are fixed with no functionality lost: # Sort array 1 bubblesort ( arr = arr1 ) # Sort array 2 bubblesort ( arr = arr2 ) # Sort array 3 bubblesort ( arr = arr3 ) Re-usability is not the only benefit of functions, and just because a process is only done once does not mean that it should not be placed inside the body of a function instead.

A long process typically has several logical steps to it each of which can be delivered by a block of code. If we attempt to write out all the steps of the process in a long sequence of code this will be very difficult to read, and identifying the separate steps of the process is difficult. Below is an example from the diabetes RAP that uses functions, functions aren't being used here to cut down on code re-use but rather to make the steps of the delivered process more clear: # Step 3: Identify the best record for each person best_record = identify_best_record ( record_scores = record_scores ) # Step 4: Use the best record to cut down the record_scores table, creating the golden record golden_record = create_golden_record_table ( record_scores = record_scores , best_record = best_record ) # Step 5: Derive additional fields for the golden record table enriched_golden_record = enrich_golden_record ( golden_record = golden_record , hes_diabetes = hes_diabetes , imd_scores = imd_scores ) # Step 6: Output the golden record table to SQL so we can avoid recalculating next time write_df_to_SQL ( df_to_write = enriched_golden_record , target_table = golden_record_sql , mode = 'overwrite' , database = params [ 'work_db' ]) # Step 7: after attain the golden_record (either by saved table or generate new one), we build final table final_table = produce_aggregates ( golden_record ) It is important to note that overuse of functions like this can be a bad thing. Breaking down a process into too many functions will make code harder to read. An extreme example can demonstrate this: def sort_each_element ( arr , n ): for i in range ( n - 1 ): do_swaps ( arr = arr , i = i , n = n ) def do_swaps ( arr , i , n ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if arr [ j ] > arr [ j + 1 ]: swap ( arr = arr , j = j ) def swap ( arr , j ): arr [ j ], arr [ j + 1 ] = arr [ j + 1 ], arr [ j ] def bubblesort ( arr ): n = len ( arr ) sort_each_element ( arr , n ) This code delivers a function bubblesort which has the same functionality as the previous bubblesort example.

Without using a function we would have to change every occurrence of these variables in our long messy code: # Sort array 1 n = len ( array1 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array1 [ j ] > array1 [ j + 1 ] : array1 [ j ], array1 [ j + 1 ] = array1 [ j + 1 ], array1 [ j ] # Sort array 2 n = len ( array2 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array2 [ j ] > array2 [ j + 1 ] : array2 [ j ], array2 [ j + 1 ] = array2 [ j + 1 ], array2 [ j ] # Sort array 3 n = len ( array3 ) for i in range ( n - 1 ): for j in range ( 0 , n - i - 1 ): if array3 [ j ] > array3 [ j + 1 ] : array3 [ j ], array3 [ j + 1 ] = array3 [ j + 1 ], array3 [ j ] This is bad practice.

One of the biggest burdens on stats teams is to maintain accurate definitions of fields over time as the specifications change. This drift in definitions is also one of the biggest sources of errors in stats publications. In the worst cases you may find that a field is defined in dozens of locations across a code-base. Each of these needs to be updated each time a change happens - leading to burden and risk. Here we show that by separating the definitions of fields from the context in which you create those fields, you can easily maintain and manage those definitions over time. Moreover, these atomic field definitions become very easy to include in unit tests. In this way you can use simple data examples to ensure your outputs are accurate. This is not a general guide to unit testing. That guide is called ' unit-testing.md '. Field definitions and how to use them As was previously mentioned analysts will typically have several planned definitions for certain fields/columns of data. What can happen with these definitions is that they become repeated throughout the code base whenever they are needed; this leads to long messy code that is hard to maintain. More specifically having these definitions in many locations leads to two issues arising if the specification for one of these definitions changes: The task of updating the old field definition with the new one in every place the old one occurred is time-consuming and annoying. Furthermore, the process of updating this definition in many locations can lead to bugs and inconsistencies which we have no way of checking for. We have no consistent way of checking if our definition is correct if it occurs in many places in the code. Instead of having field definition code in many places throughout the code base it would be preferable to have the code which defines the field in one place, and then re-use that definition. What this would mean is that if a change in specifications occurred then all we would have to do is change the code of that initial definition rather than the code in every place it is used. PySpark provides a very tidy way of doing this, which has been used in the diabetes RAP: foot_denom = ( F . when (( F . col ( 'AGE' ) >= 12 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) cvd_admission = ( F . when ( F . col ( 'NHS_NUMBER' ) . isNotNull (), 1 ) . otherwise ( None ) ) no_cvd_on_statins_40_to_80 = ( F . when (( F . col ( 'CVD_ADMISSION' ) . isNull ()) & ( F . col ( 'IHD_VALUE' ) . isNull ()) & ( F . col ( 'STATIN_FLAG' ) == 1 ) & ( F . col ( 'AGE' ) >= 40 ) & ( F . col ( 'AGE' ) <= 80 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) In the code above three field definitions are given: A foot_denom field which has a value of 1 if the 'AGE' column has a value of 12 or more, otherwise has a value of 0. A cvd_admission field which has a value of 1 if there is a value in the 'NHS_NUMBER' field otherwise has a null value (None). A no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 field which has a value of 1 if: - The 'CVD_ADMISSION' and 'IHD_VALUE' columns both have a null value. - And the 'STATIN_FLAG' column has a value of 1. - And the 'AGE' column has a value between 40 and 80 inclusive. - Otherwise no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 has a value of 0 With our fields defined we can now re-use them without having to write out their logic every time we do so. For example: my_dataframe . withColumn ( 'FOOT_DENOM' , foot_denom ) . withColumn ( 'CVD_ADMISSION' , cvd_admission ) . withColumn ( 'NO_CVD_ON_STATINS_50_TO_80' , no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 ) In the code above several columns are added to the existing table (dataframe) my_dataframe . The first parameter in withColumn is what the name of the column will be in the table, the second parameter is one of our pre-defined field definitions. In the diabetes RAP all of our field definitions are kept in one file called field_definitions.py . Our field definitions can be re-used like this anywhere they are needed. This also solves the first issue mentioned before, as now if the specification of one of these field definitions changed all we would need to do is change the code that occurs in the first example (the initial definition/the code in field_definitions.py ). Testing field definitions There is still the second issue to deal with; namely how do we know our field definition is correct? Another benefit of breaking out atomic field definitions into the smallest units they can be is that we can now apply unit tests to them. Why should we bother to write these unit tests? Especially for something as simple as our field definitions. Unit tests test for functionality not code. This means that we base the expected output of a unit test on our design. This is well suited to field definitions as it means our metric for whether or not our field definitions are correct is based on our initial design decisions. We can then setup these tests with static data. All of our field definitions tests passing means all of our field definitions are correct. This also future-proofs our code. If someone makes a change to a field definition by mistake the test for it will fail and we will catch bugs early. Now when we need to change the specifications for a field definition we go through the following steps: Plan out the adjusted field definition and all the expected values it should output on various inputs. Now we have the design of the adjusted field definition update our tests to reflect it. Rewrite the code defining the field definition so that it passes our test. We have now solved both of our initial worries with field definitions: Our actual field definition code only occurs in one place so changes in specification are not cumbersome to deal with. We now have unit tests as a metric to make sure our field definitions fulfil our design correctly. Choosing data examples to test a field definition The benefits of unit testing field definitions mostly come back to this idea that unit tests reflect our design. Therefore, one of the most important aspects of designing these tests is to select data that covers all the kinds of cases our field definition needs to deal with. This process should ideally function like a dialogue between the developer (D) and the responsible statistician (S), and should elucidate the design of the field definition more. For example: \u2014 S : \"I want a field that has a value of 1 when the column 'AGE' has a value more than 12\" \u2014 D : \"So any value more than 12 should give 1, what if 'AGE' is less than 12?\" \u2014 S : \"In that case we can set the value to 0\" \u2014 D : \"What if the value of 'AGE' is equal to 12?\" \u2014 S : \"It makes sense to have 1 also in that case\" \u2014 D : \"What if the value of 'AGE' is 0, should we do something else?\" \u2014 S : \"0 is still an acceptable value for 'AGE' in this case, so we would still set the value of the field to 0\" \u2014 D : \"What if age is negative?\" \u2014 S : \"While that is a strange case I think for this field all we are trying to show is the value of 'AGE' is more than or equal to 12, so we would still set the value of the new field to 0\" \u2014 D : \"Fair enough, what should we do about a NULL value in the 'AGE' column?\" \u2014 S : \"That's a trickier case but in my opinion it's the same as a negative age, all that matters is that if the 'AGE' column has a value greater than or equal to 12 we set this field to 1, so for any other value we can set it to 0.\" There are three kinds of cases to deal with: Expected cases where the kinds of values we expect give a normal output. Erroneous cases where bad values should be dealt with by our code by throwing out an error. Edge cases where certain boundary/extreme values may need to be dealt with in a special way. Edge cases are the cases that are the most important to define, as they require specific design decisions to be made. Through their dialogue S and D were able to identify a complete range of cases for this new field definition, we can specify example input values as well which we will use in our tests: Case type Case Example input Expected output Edge AGE < 0 -1 0 Edge AGE = 0 0 0 Expected AGE < 12 11 0 Edge/Expected AGE = 12 12 1 Expected AGE > 12 13, 20 1 Edge AGE is NULL None 0 With these cases outlined a test can actually be written for our new cholesterol_denominator field: class TestCholesterolDenominator ( object ): \"\"\" cholesterol_denominator = ( F.when((F.col('AGE') >= 12), 1).otherwise(0) ) \"\"\" @pytest . mark . usefixtures ( \"spark_session\" ) def test_valid_invalid_age_returns_correct_chol_denom ( self , spark_session ): input_df = spark_session . createDataFrame ( [ ( - 1 , '2021-02-13' ), ( 0 , '2021-02-13' ), ( 11 , '2021-02-13' ), ( 12 , '2021-02-13' ), ( 13 , '2021-02-13' ), ( 20 , '2021-02-13' ), ( None , '2021-02-13' ) ], [ \"AGE\" , \"CHOLESTEROL_DATE\" ] ) return_df = ( input_df . withColumn ( 'CHOLESTEROL_DEN' , cholesterol_denominator )) expected = [ 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 ] actual = [ row [ 'CHOLESTEROL_DEN' ] for row in return_df . collect ()] assert actual == expected , f \"When checking cholesterol denominator, expected to find { expected } but found { actual } \" The spark_session is simply a PySpark session which we pass to our tests, this spark session allows us to create static dataframes to test. As we can see in the test above there is a dataframe input_df which has all the values needed to cover the cases outlined before. We the get a new dataframe return_df by adding our new field cholesterol_denominator to input_df using the withColumn method. We can store our expected values in a list in the same order as the table above. Finally we can compare the values in our new column with the expected values to assert they are all correct.

One of the biggest burdens on stats teams is to maintain accurate definitions of fields over time as the specifications change. This drift in definitions is also one of the biggest sources of errors in stats publications. In the worst cases you may find that a field is defined in dozens of locations across a code-base. Each of these needs to be updated each time a change happens - leading to burden and risk. Here we show that by separating the definitions of fields from the context in which you create those fields, you can easily maintain and manage those definitions over time. Moreover, these atomic field definitions become very easy to include in unit tests. In this way you can use simple data examples to ensure your outputs are accurate. This is not a general guide to unit testing. That guide is called ' unit-testing.md '.","title":""},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing-field-definitions/#field-definitions-and-how-to-use-them","text":"As was previously mentioned analysts will typically have several planned definitions for certain fields/columns of data. What can happen with these definitions is that they become repeated throughout the code base whenever they are needed; this leads to long messy code that is hard to maintain. More specifically having these definitions in many locations leads to two issues arising if the specification for one of these definitions changes: The task of updating the old field definition with the new one in every place the old one occurred is time-consuming and annoying. Furthermore, the process of updating this definition in many locations can lead to bugs and inconsistencies which we have no way of checking for. We have no consistent way of checking if our definition is correct if it occurs in many places in the code. Instead of having field definition code in many places throughout the code base it would be preferable to have the code which defines the field in one place, and then re-use that definition. What this would mean is that if a change in specifications occurred then all we would have to do is change the code of that initial definition rather than the code in every place it is used. PySpark provides a very tidy way of doing this, which has been used in the diabetes RAP: foot_denom = ( F . when (( F . col ( 'AGE' ) >= 12 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) cvd_admission = ( F . when ( F . col ( 'NHS_NUMBER' ) . isNotNull (), 1 ) . otherwise ( None ) ) no_cvd_on_statins_40_to_80 = ( F . when (( F . col ( 'CVD_ADMISSION' ) . isNull ()) & ( F . col ( 'IHD_VALUE' ) . isNull ()) & ( F . col ( 'STATIN_FLAG' ) == 1 ) & ( F . col ( 'AGE' ) >= 40 ) & ( F . col ( 'AGE' ) <= 80 ), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) In the code above three field definitions are given: A foot_denom field which has a value of 1 if the 'AGE' column has a value of 12 or more, otherwise has a value of 0. A cvd_admission field which has a value of 1 if there is a value in the 'NHS_NUMBER' field otherwise has a null value (None). A no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 field which has a value of 1 if: - The 'CVD_ADMISSION' and 'IHD_VALUE' columns both have a null value. - And the 'STATIN_FLAG' column has a value of 1. - And the 'AGE' column has a value between 40 and 80 inclusive. - Otherwise no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 has a value of 0 With our fields defined we can now re-use them without having to write out their logic every time we do so. For example: my_dataframe . withColumn ( 'FOOT_DENOM' , foot_denom ) . withColumn ( 'CVD_ADMISSION' , cvd_admission ) . withColumn ( 'NO_CVD_ON_STATINS_50_TO_80' , no_cvd_on_statins_50_to_80 ) In the code above several columns are added to the existing table (dataframe) my_dataframe . The first parameter in withColumn is what the name of the column will be in the table, the second parameter is one of our pre-defined field definitions. In the diabetes RAP all of our field definitions are kept in one file called field_definitions.py . Our field definitions can be re-used like this anywhere they are needed. This also solves the first issue mentioned before, as now if the specification of one of these field definitions changed all we would need to do is change the code that occurs in the first example (the initial definition/the code in field_definitions.py ).","title":"Field definitions and how to use them"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing-field-definitions/#testing-field-definitions","text":"There is still the second issue to deal with; namely how do we know our field definition is correct? Another benefit of breaking out atomic field definitions into the smallest units they can be is that we can now apply unit tests to them. Why should we bother to write these unit tests? Especially for something as simple as our field definitions. Unit tests test for functionality not code. This means that we base the expected output of a unit test on our design. This is well suited to field definitions as it means our metric for whether or not our field definitions are correct is based on our initial design decisions. We can then setup these tests with static data. All of our field definitions tests passing means all of our field definitions are correct. This also future-proofs our code. If someone makes a change to a field definition by mistake the test for it will fail and we will catch bugs early. Now when we need to change the specifications for a field definition we go through the following steps: Plan out the adjusted field definition and all the expected values it should output on various inputs. Now we have the design of the adjusted field definition update our tests to reflect it. Rewrite the code defining the field definition so that it passes our test. We have now solved both of our initial worries with field definitions: Our actual field definition code only occurs in one place so changes in specification are not cumbersome to deal with.

If all assertions are correct then the test passes, if at least one assertion is incorrect then the test fails. Tests are a useful metric for deciding if an application has met its requirements. Unit tests test a single piece of functionality, this functionality is delivered by a single unit of code such as a method. The philosophy behind unit tests is that if the functionality of the smallest units of the program can be guaranteed, then it is significantly more likely that the project as a whole is succeeding in delivering its functionality. Benefits of testing When discussing the benefits of testing this guide will use the example field definitions to show testing in the context of RAP. For example take the field \"CREATININE_DATE\" we want another field \"CREATININE_DATE_FLAG\" to be set to 1 when there is a date value in \"CREATININE_DATE\" and 0 otherwise. We write some PySpark code to achieve this: creatinine_date_flag = ( F . when ( F . col ( \"CREATININE_DATE\" ) . isNotNull (), 1 ) . otherwise ( 0 ) ) What are the benefits of writing a test for this small piece of code? General Benefits It confirms for us that the code we have written has been successful in delivering the field definition we want. We could of course do this manually, but writing tests also gives other benefits. Tests persist as functions and can be re-run over and over; this is cumbersome with manual testing. This future-proofs our code. If we write our field definition code and it passes the test then we know it works. If in future when we re-run our tests we see that the test now fails then we know that a fundamental part of our program has been broken. Tests allow us to catch bugs early. Tests provide an additional kind of documentation. As was mentioned in the introduction the goal of unit tests is to test a single piece of functionality. Therefore what a collection of tests passing describe is not that our code is good but rather that our code is delivering the desired functionality of the program. By viewing the results of our testing and seeing which test functions pass we are able to see what the planned and delivered functionality of the project is and what considerations have been made. Tests improve general code quality not just correctness. Unit tests should be testing for a smallest unit of functionality and that functionality is typically delivered by a function in our code. If we struggle to write a unit test because we can't figure out what functions to use then our code is not modular enough and that we should break down our processing steps in our code into more functions. Tests allow us to run smaller parts of code in isolation. This means that we could check to see if all the code we wrote for each of our field definitions is delivering its desired functionality. If instead we tried to run the whole program to do this it would be hard to tell if issues were arising because our code delivering the function was wrong, or because some other part of the program is causing an issue. Tests are simple to write. They often use a repeated pattern of code and for such a small amount of effort a huge reward is reaped. Test-driven development Test driven development (TDD) is a developmental approach in which tests are written before the code is, and then development begins. This may seem obtuse but the benefit is that it forces us to design our tests first based only on the desired functionality that the program should deliver. This leads to a couple of things: If all of our tests pass then we know we have delivered all the functionality the program needs. We have to break down our project and write functions to deliver these units of functionality, rather than writing tests for our functions. It prevents us from having tunnel-vision when it comes to code. As our attention will always be brought back to our tests which are based on the higher-level context of the functionality the project should deliver. It forces us to make sure that we understand the goals of the project before we start writing code. While a perfect TDD approach can be hard to achieve, maintaining its general goals will keep a project more focused. Field definitions provide an excellent example of where TDD could be useful. To apply TDD we would need to properly plan out our field definitions before hand (perhaps by looking at pre-existing SQL code if we are transitioning to PySpark). We can then write tests for each of these field definitions with the expected values we have planned to show that they are a fundamental part of the project. Initially all these tests will fail but over the course of development more will pass until we know that all of our field definitions have been implemented according to our initial plan. Migration Whether we follow TDD or not our collection of tests will grow as we notice the requirement for more functionalities in the project. When the project is completed we should ideally have a complete suite of tests which all pass, and which covers all the planned functionality of the project. If at a later date our project needs to be migrated to a new domain we will still have all of our tests. Re-running our tests after migration will help reveal two things: If our migration failed our tests failing should pinpoint what, if anything, is now broken in the project. If our migration appears to have succeeded our tests failing will pinpoint functionality that is now broken in the project that we would otherwise have missed. How to design tests It is important to take the step of designing and planning tests before you write them. Writing a bad test which doesn't accurately reflect the design of the project can do more harm than good. What should the test(s) be about? The first thing to be settled is what the test should be testing. Always keep in mind is that what is being tested should be the desired functionality of the program rather than testing code that has been written. For example the wrong process would be: I have written the field definition registrations_denominator in the diabetes RAP project code. I expect this code to return a data frame with a new \"REGISTRATIONS\" field with values set to 0 when no NHS number is present and 1 if one is present. I should write a test using this definition with these values. This is bad as the focus has shifted from what the project should be delivering in terms of functionality, to instead being about what we think the expected values of some abstract function/definition should be. We need to focus on functionality. In the case of unit tests this functionality should be the smallest units of functionality that need to be delivered. For example we might propose the following: In the RAP diabetes project there are a number of field definitions. We need to guarantee this core functionality should work. We should write a test to check if all of our field definitions are correct. This is incorrect. The functionality can be broken down into smaller units, for example: The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a registrations field. The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a creatinine date flag field. The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a ... field. ... We need to write tests for each of these core units of functionality. We have now identified several pieces of functionality that need to be tested. Always keep in mind that a unit test only tests for that one piece of functionality; it should not test for the interaction between different parts of the program. How many tests and what data should the tests use? Once we have identified our functionality to test we need to determine how many tests we need to demonstrate that functionality has been delivered. It is important to note two general practices around unit tests: The code for the test itself is as short as possible while still being readable. The test only makes one logical assertion (check if an input leads to the expected output). Too many logical assertions obscure the goal of the test and the test should instead be split into multiple tests. Based on these features we will need a unit test for each case the functionality needs to handle. There are typically three kinds of cases: Expected cases. Cases where the input is 'good' and our code delivers the expected output. Erroneous cases. Cases where the input is 'bad' and our code handles this in some way (such as by throwing an exception) and exits gracefully. Edge cases. Cases where the input is likely to require special handling by our function (extreme cases). Lets take the example of sorting a list. We have identified that our project needs to support the small unit of functionality to sort a list of integers into ascending order. We can identify some cases to test quickly: Type of case Behaviour Expected A list in ascending order should be returned unchanged Expected A list in descending order should be returned in ascending order Expected A list in a random order should be returned in ascending order Erroneous A list that contains a null/none value should throw an exception Erroneous A list that contains data of the wrong type (string, float etc) should throw an exception Edge An empty list should not throw an exception, and an empty list should be returned Edge A list with repeated values should be sorted like normal with repeated values interchangeable We have now identified 7 unit tests for this piece of functionality. The process of figuring out cases has also elucidated two more things: The input data to our tests has been outlined as well as the expected results. We have made our design decisions more explicit and open. For example our two edge cases could be seen as erroneous cases by someone with a different view. They may want lists which are empty/contain repeated values to throw an exception rather than be treated as correct. Because our tests reflect our design the only acceptable result for our tests is all of them passing. We cannot ignore a failed test as it means our code does not live up to our design. It is also debatable if we need all three of our expected cases and whether one would just do. This is generally up to how much test coverage you feel a feature needs but it is important to note that you should not have tests which repeat themselves and you should not have tests which test for the same thing as this will make your collection of tests cluttered. What should the test be named? It is important in general to have good function names but this is especially true in the case of unit tests. There are some reasons for this: Test suites grow to be very large, and test code is difficult to read. Team members who have not written some of the tests need to run the test suite and understand the result. Sometimes non-programmers/those not as involved in development need to run the test suite and understand the result. Therefore when naming a test we need to describe what functionality the test is for, what kind of data is being used as input, and what is the expected output. There is no set method for naming tests but a good starting point is to simply describe the test as if you were explaining it to someone with knowledge of the programs domain but not much programming knowledge. This generally leads to clear test names. Here are some more specific tips for writing test names: Make sure every word in the test name is separated by an underscore. A test called dividingTwoNumbersIsInvalidWhenDividingByZero is difficult to read compared to dividing_two_numbers_is_invalid_when_dividing_by_zero . Don't worry too much about conforming to a specific test naming scheme such as '[method name]_Should[expected result]_When[conditions]'. While a scheme can make test names more uniform it doesn't necessarily make them more readable. The thought you should always have when naming the test is to simply explain what the test is testing for as if you were explaining it to someone with basic knowledge of the project. Try to avoid using the function name in the test such as divideTwoNumbers_invalid_when_dividing_by_zero as this suggests you are testing a function rather than trying to get the function to deliver the desired functionality. Something like division_by_zero_is_invalid is a much better test name. When using pytest always prepend test_ at the start of your test's name. Drop hopeful language such as should or will and instead just describe the desired functionality. Avoid technical jargon where possible, words such as returns in a test name make it difficult for someone with less programming knowledge to understand the goal of the test. While keeping these tips in mind is beneficial don't stress too much about following them exactly, and it is ok to ignore some or all of them as long as you come up with a test name that quickly conveys what the test is about. How to write unit tests This guide will not focus on all the basic setup and features of pytest as this is better covered in external resources (one of which can be found at the top of this guide). There are however some other tips for actually writing tests that can be helpful. Test suites (where to put your tests) Your test functions will obviously be stored in a file but having all of your tests in one file can become messy. At some point we need to plan how to organise and lay out our tests in order to make best use of them. In a RAP project you will typically have three kinds of tests: Unit tests which have been covered in this guide. Integration tests which test the interaction between modules of the program (occurs after unit testing). Backtesting used to check how successful the pipeline is on historical data. These three classes of tests need to be separated out. The simplest way to do this is to have a subfolder in your main tests folder for each fo these kinds of tests, and then within these subfolders have Python files containing the tests: \"tests\": \"unittests\": unit test code \"integration\" integration test code \"backtesting\" backtesting code We may also want to separate out our tests further into domains. For example we could have all of our unit tests in one file in the unit tests subfolder. Alternatively we may have several files for unit tests for different parts of the project. For example in the diabetes RAP we have: test_data_connections.py test_field_definitions.py test_schema_definitions.py The goal with separating out tests like this is to make our collection of tests as readable and as uncluttered as possible. A final pattern which is useful to follow to keep test collections tidy is to contain the unit test functions themselves in a class related to the functionality they deliver. For example in the diabetes RAP we have the following: class TestCholesterolNumerator ( object ): \"\"\" cholesterol_numerator = ( F.when((F.col('AGE') >= 12) & (F.col(\"CHOLESTEROL_DATE\").isNotNull()), 1).otherwise(0) ) \"\"\" @pytest . mark . usefixtures ( \"spark_session\" ) def test_valid_invalid_age_returns_correct_chol_numerator ( self , spark_session ): ... @pytest . mark . usefixtures ( \"spark_session\" ) def test_valid_invalid_cholesterol_date_returns_correct_chol_numer ( self , spark_session ): (Test function bodies omitted for brevity). The functionality we are testing for is a cholesterol_numerator field definition so we create a class for this functionality called TestCholesterolNumerator . We have identified we need two tests to guarantee this functionality so we write these tests as we normally would but put them within the TestCholesterolNumerator class. This makes it clear what functionality each test relates to.

We have to break down our project and write functions to deliver these units of functionality, rather than writing tests for our functions. It prevents us from having tunnel-vision when it comes to code. As our attention will always be brought back to our tests which are based on the higher-level context of the functionality the project should deliver. It forces us to make sure that we understand the goals of the project before we start writing code. While a perfect TDD approach can be hard to achieve, maintaining its general goals will keep a project more focused. Field definitions provide an excellent example of where TDD could be useful. To apply TDD we would need to properly plan out our field definitions before hand (perhaps by looking at pre-existing SQL code if we are transitioning to PySpark). We can then write tests for each of these field definitions with the expected values we have planned to show that they are a fundamental part of the project. Initially all these tests will fail but over the course of development more will pass until we know that all of our field definitions have been implemented according to our initial plan.","title":"Test-driven development"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#migration","text":"Whether we follow TDD or not our collection of tests will grow as we notice the requirement for more functionalities in the project. When the project is completed we should ideally have a complete suite of tests which all pass, and which covers all the planned functionality of the project. If at a later date our project needs to be migrated to a new domain we will still have all of our tests. Re-running our tests after migration will help reveal two things: If our migration failed our tests failing should pinpoint what, if anything, is now broken in the project. If our migration appears to have succeeded our tests failing will pinpoint functionality that is now broken in the project that we would otherwise have missed.","title":"Migration"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#how-to-design-tests","text":"It is important to take the step of designing and planning tests before you write them. Writing a bad test which doesn't accurately reflect the design of the project can do more harm than good.","title":"How to design tests"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#what-should-the-tests-be-about","text":"The first thing to be settled is what the test should be testing. Always keep in mind is that what is being tested should be the desired functionality of the program rather than testing code that has been written. For example the wrong process would be: I have written the field definition registrations_denominator in the diabetes RAP project code. I expect this code to return a data frame with a new \"REGISTRATIONS\" field with values set to 0 when no NHS number is present and 1 if one is present. I should write a test using this definition with these values. This is bad as the focus has shifted from what the project should be delivering in terms of functionality, to instead being about what we think the expected values of some abstract function/definition should be. We need to focus on functionality. In the case of unit tests this functionality should be the smallest units of functionality that need to be delivered. For example we might propose the following: In the RAP diabetes project there are a number of field definitions. We need to guarantee this core functionality should work. We should write a test to check if all of our field definitions are correct. This is incorrect. The functionality can be broken down into smaller units, for example: The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a registrations field. The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a creatinine date flag field. The RAP diabetes project needs a definition for a ... field. ... We need to write tests for each of these core units of functionality. We have now identified several pieces of functionality that need to be tested. Always keep in mind that a unit test only tests for that one piece of functionality; it should not test for the interaction between different parts of the program.","title":"What should the test(s) be about?"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#how-many-tests-and-what-data-should-the-tests-use","text":"Once we have identified our functionality to test we need to determine how many tests we need to demonstrate that functionality has been delivered. It is important to note two general practices around unit tests: The code for the test itself is as short as possible while still being readable. The test only makes one logical assertion (check if an input leads to the expected output). Too many logical assertions obscure the goal of the test and the test should instead be split into multiple tests. Based on these features we will need a unit test for each case the functionality needs to handle. There are typically three kinds of cases: Expected cases. Cases where the input is 'good' and our code delivers the expected output. Erroneous cases. Cases where the input is 'bad' and our code handles this in some way (such as by throwing an exception) and exits gracefully. Edge cases. Cases where the input is likely to require special handling by our function (extreme cases). Lets take the example of sorting a list. We have identified that our project needs to support the small unit of functionality to sort a list of integers into ascending order. We can identify some cases to test quickly: Type of case Behaviour Expected A list in ascending order should be returned unchanged Expected A list in descending order should be returned in ascending order Expected A list in a random order should be returned in ascending order Erroneous A list that contains a null/none value should throw an exception Erroneous A list that contains data of the wrong type (string, float etc) should throw an exception Edge An empty list should not throw an exception, and an empty list should be returned Edge A list with repeated values should be sorted like normal with repeated values interchangeable We have now identified 7 unit tests for this piece of functionality. The process of figuring out cases has also elucidated two more things: The input data to our tests has been outlined as well as the expected results. We have made our design decisions more explicit and open. For example our two edge cases could be seen as erroneous cases by someone with a different view. They may want lists which are empty/contain repeated values to throw an exception rather than be treated as correct. Because our tests reflect our design the only acceptable result for our tests is all of them passing. We cannot ignore a failed test as it means our code does not live up to our design. It is also debatable if we need all three of our expected cases and whether one would just do. This is generally up to how much test coverage you feel a feature needs but it is important to note that you should not have tests which repeat themselves and you should not have tests which test for the same thing as this will make your collection of tests cluttered.","title":"How many tests and what data should the tests use?"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#what-should-the-test-be-named","text":"It is important in general to have good function names but this is especially true in the case of unit tests. There are some reasons for this: Test suites grow to be very large, and test code is difficult to read. Team members who have not written some of the tests need to run the test suite and understand the result. Sometimes non-programmers/those not as involved in development need to run the test suite and understand the result. Therefore when naming a test we need to describe what functionality the test is for, what kind of data is being used as input, and what is the expected output. There is no set method for naming tests but a good starting point is to simply describe the test as if you were explaining it to someone with knowledge of the programs domain but not much programming knowledge. This generally leads to clear test names. Here are some more specific tips for writing test names: Make sure every word in the test name is separated by an underscore. A test called dividingTwoNumbersIsInvalidWhenDividingByZero is difficult to read compared to dividing_two_numbers_is_invalid_when_dividing_by_zero . Don't worry too much about conforming to a specific test naming scheme such as '[method name]_Should[expected result]_When[conditions]'. While a scheme can make test names more uniform it doesn't necessarily make them more readable. The thought you should always have when naming the test is to simply explain what the test is testing for as if you were explaining it to someone with basic knowledge of the project. Try to avoid using the function name in the test such as divideTwoNumbers_invalid_when_dividing_by_zero as this suggests you are testing a function rather than trying to get the function to deliver the desired functionality. Something like division_by_zero_is_invalid is a much better test name. When using pytest always prepend test_ at the start of your test's name. Drop hopeful language such as should or will and instead just describe the desired functionality. Avoid technical jargon where possible, words such as returns in a test name make it difficult for someone with less programming knowledge to understand the goal of the test. While keeping these tips in mind is beneficial don't stress too much about following them exactly, and it is ok to ignore some or all of them as long as you come up with a test name that quickly conveys what the test is about.","title":"What should the test be named?"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#how-to-write-unit-tests","text":"This guide will not focus on all the basic setup and features of pytest as this is better covered in external resources (one of which can be found at the top of this guide). There are however some other tips for actually writing tests that can be helpful.","title":"How to write unit tests"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#test-suites-where-to-put-your-tests","text":"Your test functions will obviously be stored in a file but having all of your tests in one file can become messy. At some point we need to plan how to organise and lay out our tests in order to make best use of them. In a RAP project you will typically have three kinds of tests: Unit tests which have been covered in this guide. Integration tests which test the interaction between modules of the program (occurs after unit testing). Backtesting used to check how successful the pipeline is on historical data. These three classes of tests need to be separated out. The simplest way to do this is to have a subfolder in your main tests folder for each fo these kinds of tests, and then within these subfolders have Python files containing the tests: \"tests\": \"unittests\": unit test code \"integration\" integration test code \"backtesting\" backtesting code We may also want to separate out our tests further into domains. For example we could have all of our unit tests in one file in the unit tests subfolder. Alternatively we may have several files for unit tests for different parts of the project. For example in the diabetes RAP we have: test_data_connections.py test_field_definitions.py test_schema_definitions.py The goal with separating out tests like this is to make our collection of tests as readable and as uncluttered as possible. A final pattern which is useful to follow to keep test collections tidy is to contain the unit test functions themselves in a class related to the functionality they deliver. For example in the diabetes RAP we have the following: class TestCholesterolNumerator ( object ): \"\"\" cholesterol_numerator = ( F.when((F.col('AGE') >= 12) & (F.col(\"CHOLESTEROL_DATE\").isNotNull()), 1).otherwise(0) ) \"\"\" @pytest . mark . usefixtures ( \"spark_session\" ) def test_valid_invalid_age_returns_correct_chol_numerator ( self , spark_session ): ... @pytest . mark . usefixtures ( \"spark_session\" ) def test_valid_invalid_cholesterol_date_returns_correct_chol_numer ( self , spark_session ): (Test function bodies omitted for brevity). The functionality we are testing for is a cholesterol_numerator field definition so we create a class for this functionality called TestCholesterolNumerator . We have identified we need two tests to guarantee this functionality so we write these tests as we normally would but put them within the TestCholesterolNumerator class. This makes it clear what functionality each test relates to.","title":"Test suites (where to put your tests)"},{"location":"training_resources/python/unit-testing/#external-links","text":"Guide covering all the core features of pytest","title":"External links"},{"location":"training_resources/python/visualisation-in-python/","tags":["Data visualisation","Python","Matplotlib","Accessibility","Pandas","Numpy"],"text":"Creating visualisations can require a lot of effort.

You can interact with conda via the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for Mac/Linux. By inputting commands in the command prompt you can then create and manage your virtual environments using the conda package manager. See the Anaconda user guides for more information on getting started with conda. How to create a new virtual environment using conda To create a new conda virtual environment for your project, open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a terminal window on Mac/Linus and enter: conda create --name myenvironment python=3.9 The --name tag specifies a name for the environment: in this example the environment will be named \"myenvironment\", but you can replace this will something better suited to your project. python=3.9 specifies Python version you wish the virtual environment to run, in this case version 3.9. To check the packages that are installed in the active environment , enter: conda list To install a package the active environment: conda install pandas To create an environment, specify the Python version and install multiple packages in one line : conda create --name mynewenvironment python=3.8 pandas 3.1.0 flake8 3.9.2 numpy Notice how the versions for pandas and flake8 are specified but no version is given for numpy. This will result in all versions of numpy being installed. TIP: It is recommended to install all packages in one go (e.g. numpy, pandas, pytest etc). Installing 1 package at a time could cause potential package dependency conflicts (see Dependency Hell ). If you're unsure a specific package is installed in the current environment simply search: conda search flake8 For more information on managing environments and other commands such as updating your environment's packages, check out Managing environments with Conda . How to activate an environment The 'active' environment is the one that conda will reference when you enter any commands, e.g. new packages will be installed into the active environment, the installed package list will be based on the active environment, etc. When you start a new Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or open a new terminal (Mac/Linux), the active current environment is set to base . To activate an environment, enter: conda activate mynewenvironment As above, \"myenvironment\" specifies the name of the environment and can be replaced with the specific name of the environment you wish to activate. How to export and share environments To ensure reproducibility, it is important that we can export virtual environments and share them alongside the code. In this way, someone else will be able to run your code with exactly the same environment (packages, dependencies etc) as you did. This helps address the classic 'it works on my machine' problem. There are a few options for how to export environments and recreated environments from exported files. Pip requirements.txt If you followed the Project structure and package organisation guide, you will have created a requirements.txt file in your repository, which specifies all the Python packages you wish to install. The benefit of a requirements.txt file created with Pip is that anyone with a Python installation should be able to install it (i.e. someone else wouldn't need to have conda installed) The drawback is that the requirements.txt file offers an incomplete specification for the environment (for example, it does not specify the Python version), so projects using requirements.txt files must be careful to specify any additional dependencies in another way (e.g. via a README). To create a working conda environment using the requirements.txt file, simply follow the conda environment creation commands from above and instead of the simple package installation, first activate the target environment: conda activate mynewenviroment And then enter: conda install --file requirements.txt Conda environment.yml Conda offers a way to export and share environments via a yaml file. The benefit of this approach is that the output file gives a more complete picture of the dependencies for a project than a requirements.txt file from Pip. The drawback is the someone would need to have conda installed to use your project: if you work in an organisation or team that consistently uses conda then this is not as relevant, but it may be more relevant if you want to distribute you project to others who may not use conda. To export the active environment: conda env export > environment.yml The resulting file can be used to completely rebuild a conda environment: conda env create --file environment.yml How to remove an environment Make sure your environment is not active by typing: conda deactivate This will take you back to the base conda environment. Then to delete your specified environment: conda env remove --name mynewenvironment Conda help command Type the following command for a list of helpful terminal commands: conda env --help See Also Using Spyder with conda environments Spyder is a Python IDE that is bundled with Anaconda during installation. It can be tricky to set up Spyder to work with multiple conda environments: see this guide for instructions on how to do this.

The benefit of a requirements.txt file created with Pip is that anyone with a Python installation should be able to install it (i.e. someone else wouldn't need to have conda installed) The drawback is that the requirements.txt file offers an incomplete specification for the environment (for example, it does not specify the Python version), so projects using requirements.txt files must be careful to specify any additional dependencies in another way (e.g. via a README). To create a working conda environment using the requirements.txt file, simply follow the conda environment creation commands from above and instead of the simple package installation, first activate the target environment: conda activate mynewenviroment And then enter: conda install --file requirements.txt","title":"Pip requirements.txt"},{"location":"training_resources/python/virtual-environments/conda/#conda-environmentyml","text":"Conda offers a way to export and share environments via a yaml file.

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for each project. This is one of the most important tools that most Python developers use. Why use virtual environments? Virtual environments are a way to make sure your code will run correctly for you and others. By always coding inside a virtual environment, you make it more likely that your work will be usable by others. If someone tries to run your code but they are using a different version of Python then it might fail. Likewise, if your code depends on some packages but your users have a different version of that package installed that might also fail. Worse than this - if you have multiple projects then one project depends on 'my_example_library_v1' while another project needs to use 'my_example_library_v2' then both projects will break. Sometimes the code you have might depend on outdated versions of a package as the latest package update introduces bugs and issues. Or, you might have multiple versions of code that need different versions of packages to run. Virtual environments address these situations by keeping all of the packages and versions for each project separate. I can create a virtual environment called 'project-1-env' that uses Python 2.7 and 'my_example_library_v1'. I can create a second virtual environment called 'project-2-env' that uses Python 3.8 and 'my_example_library_v2'. As you move from working on one project to another, you just need to switch to the environment associated with that work. It is good practice to always code inside a virtual environment. How to create a virtual environment There are many ways to create virtual environments in python. This guide will go through the essentials for creating a virtual environment with conda and for creating a virtual environment with venv . What is conda and venv? Conda is an open source package and environment management system. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of Anaconda and Miniconda. Conda is associated with the Anaconda package repository but, conda can use pip and pull from PyPI if needed. The advantage of using conda is that you can export and share environments using an environments.yml file which specifies the environment completely, including Python version. The venv module is part of python\u2019s standard library and supports creating virtual environments, each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories. Venv is associated with the PyPI package repository. The advantage of using venv is that it is ready to use with a fresh install of Python with no prerequisites, whereas to use conda you must first install a version of Anaconda. Note You may not have a choice about which environment you can use. Your organisation may choose to use one over the other, and this might be dictated by their choice of systems, i.e. if they have chosen to make a \"PyPi\" mirror using \"Bandersnatch\", you will need to use venv.","title":"Why use virtual environments?"},{"location":"training_resources/python/virtual-environments/why-use-virtual-environments/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"training_resources/python/virtual-environments/why-use-virtual-environments/#what-are-virtual-environments","text":"A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for each project.
