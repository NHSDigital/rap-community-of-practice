# Structure of the team:

Following the recommendations in the [Overcoming Barriers to RAP](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/)
 report, we have set up a central RAP team to coordinate efforts and set standards across NHSD. 
 
 We have 6 data scientists right now but have flexed squad size up and down.

Over time, we hope that the central RAP team can be resourced with a mix of data scientists and analysts - reflecting the two roles in NHSD for whom RAP practices are most relevant. We think that this collaborative approach to resourcing will make it more likely that the whole community owns the problem. 

There are already lots of people playing an informal 'RAP champion' role by supporting colleagues. This group of people would be the natural candidates to guide the NHSD RAP community over time.
