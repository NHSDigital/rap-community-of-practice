# Rollout approach

This section focussed on the management, planning, and strategy for embedding RAP practices in a large organisation. We've tried a lot of different things so far - with varying levels of success. My hope is that sharing our approach and considerations will help others. 

## ONS RAP Report
The single most valuable tool we have had in our work is the report from the ONS about 
[overcoming barriers to RAP adoption](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/). Almost every one of the considerations discussed in this report has been relevant for us in the past year. 

I would strongly encourage organisations who want to adopt RAP practices to read this report and share with senior leaders. You might also consider running a [pre-mortem](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem) with the project sponsor and senior analytical leaders to anticipate and avoid some of the problems mentioned in this report.

## NHSD rollout strategy

**Support models**. The most important principle for supporting RAP adoption in NHSD has been to adapt our offering to the needs of teams. As we have worked with different teams it has been clear that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Instead we negotiate the support model with teams based on a variety of considerations. [Learn about the different support models and considerations in the Support Models section](./support-models.md).

**Service design**. We have taken this approach a step further by framing the work of the central RAP team as a service. We have gone through a number of rounds of service design and user research. [Learn more about our approach to RAP service design](./service-design-and-user-research.md)

**Typical engagement**. One very effective way to encourage teams to engage with RAP is to give them sight of what a typical project might look like. This narrative account gives a high-level view of the activities at each phase of the engagement. [Learn about a typical engagement with the RAP team](./typical-engagement-flow.md)

**Thin-slice strategy**. When migrating an existing publication to a RAP pipeline, we often adopt a 'thin-slice' strategy. [Learn more about the thin-slice strategy for migrations](./thin-slice-strategy.md)

**Programme-level reporting**. While most of our work focussed on teams and pipelines, it is important to track roll-out at a high level. This section discussed how we track progress. [Learn more about our programme level reporting](./programme-level-reporting.md)
