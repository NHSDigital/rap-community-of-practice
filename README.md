Welcome to the landing page for the RAP community of practice website.

**The [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis), tasked with finding ways to deliver better, broader, and safer use of NHS data for analysis and research, identified RAP as the essential element to ensure high-quality analysis.**

RAP follows the principles of the [AQUA Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government) guidelines, which revolve around analysis being reproducible, auditable, transparent, and quality assured.

In a nutshell, RAP is becoming the standard for creating analytical outputs in government. RAP combines a number of ways of working that help to improve the reliability, transparency, and speed of statistics publications. Learn more on our [What is RAP][1] page.

The RAP community of practice is intended for analysts and data scientists who are interested in adopting the working practices included in [reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)][2]. It includes resources and guidance to help teams adopting RAP practices.

## Recommended reading order

We recommend reading the RAP Community of Practice in this order:

1. [What is RAP][6]
   - Learn [what RAP is][1], the [benefits][7] and the different [levels][2] you can reach
2. [Our RAP Service][5]
   - How the Data Science RAP Team can help you to implement RAP and what we do / what we have done so far
3. [Implementing RAP][3]
   - Different tools, tutorials, guides and examples to help you learn best practice coding with RAP principles and implement these within your team

## Aims

This community of practice aims to support teams in adopting RAP practices through:

1. **Developing learning materials including reusable templates**
2. **Offering support as teams establish new working practices**

See more about our [aims][7].

## Support

If your team is embarking upon a RAP journey, you should look at our [what is RAP][1] page and think about which [levels of RAP][2] that you want to target.

There are several forums where you can introduce yourself, ask for help, or discuss different approaches:

- NHS Digital RAP [MS Teams page][rap community of practice teams page] (internal to NHS Digital).
- [RAP Slack channel](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/archives/C03N1GXHEH0) from the [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) community.
- [RAP collaboration Slack channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/archives/C6H22U3H9) on the cross-government data science Slack Workspace (open to all civil servants, including NHS staff).

See more about how we can [support][9] you and your team.

## Tutorials and resources

As we work alongside teams at NHS Digital, we try to produce reusable learning materials. We try to avoid reproducing guidance that is easily available online. Instead, we link to lots of external resources where you can self-serve.

We also have created some bespoke guidance that lays out how you would accomplish these practices in the NHS Digital setting, which are available internally.

The Implementing RAP folder has its own README to explain the content on:

- [General Guidance][11]
- [Git resources][10]
- [Python resources][4]
- [PySpark resources][12]
- [R resources][8]

These resources are demand-driven so if you think of something worth including, improving, or want to contribute, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice/issues) or contact the team via the [MS Teams page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aEnoJ_c3NIwcWaLoqHyrbmiui8SI-8lZ1B2SvxNuGbyU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1c1528d7-030e-48eb-92cf-dc0f6a618ea0&tenantId=50f6071f-bbfe-401a-8803-673748e629e2) (internal to NHS Digital), or [email](mailto:datascience@nhs.net).

## Misc

We have taken inspiration from the [NHS Digital software engineering COP](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/master/insights/review.md). It has tons of great material so I encourage you to read and reflect on these working practices.
