## Strategic

- The Government Analysis Function's [RAP strategy] details the roles we all have to play in working towards RAP.
  - The ONS have also published their [RAP Strategy Implementation Plan 2023]
  - **[Other government department RAP implementation plans](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/departmental-rap-plans/)**
- The [Goldacre Review] mentions RAP extensively as a key tool in improving the use of patient data.
- The Bennett Institute of Applied Data Science has written a [helpful summary] that is helpful for understanding the above documents in the context of UK data policy developments.

## Guidance and Standards

- The [AQUA book of analytical standards].
- The [ONS best practice team have a useful website - often called the Quack book] covering many of the same topics we cover here. Their [best-practice checklist] is particularly useful.
- The Turing Institute's [The Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science]
- We have taken inspiration from the [NHS Digital software engineering COP].
- The [Health RAP Playbook], currently in alpha testing, contains specific advice on doing RAP in a healthcare setting.
- [**NHS PyCom Coding Club Github**][coding club]: Lots of great guides and lessons here from the NHS Python Community
- **[Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R](https://raps-with-r.dev/)**

## Examples, Challenges, Benefits

- [This blog post], from 2017, explains the context and history of RAP in government statistics.
- The GSS's list of [benefits that come from RAP].
- The Statistics Authority's excellent [report on overcoming barriers to RAP adoption].
- Alston, J. M., and Rick, J. A.. 2020. [A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research]. Bull Ecol Soc Am 102(2):e01801.
- The GSS training portal offers an [Introduction to RAP course]
- The Government Analysis Function conducted [research on the rollout of RAP across different departments].

## Community spaces

- There are several communities to discuss Python, R and Git in the Health and
  Public sectors:
  - **Government Data Science community** ([website][gds community website] |
    [slack][gds community slack] #rap_collaboration | [GitHub][gds community github])
    - **Government Analysis Function RAP Champion network** ([website][analysis function website])
  - **NHS Python Community (NHS-pycom)** ([website][nhs-pycom website] | [slack][nhs-pycom slack] | [GitHub][nhs-pycom github] | [Coding Club])
  - **NHS R Community** ([website][nhs-r website] | [slack][nhs-r slack] |[GitHub][nhs-r github])
  - **AnalystX** ([website][analystx website] | [Future NHS - AnalystX] | [GitHub][analystx github])
- We have an **NHS England "RAP Community of Practice" MS Teams** (internal to NHS England - contact us @ [data.science@nhs.net])
  - [NHS Digital Github]
  - Our very own [NHS England RAP Community of Practice]
