When applying RAP to health data, unique challenges may arise, particularly concerning data safety. To support those currently engaged or interested in RAP within healthcare, NHS England has launched the [Health RAP Playbook]. This resource provides valuable advice and guidance tailored for individuals working specifically in health analytics.

The playbook is designed for a diverse audience, including analysts, Information Governance professionals, and members of the public seeking insights into how their healthcare data is being processed. Presently it covers essential topics such as:

*  initiating RAP in health
* considerations for exceptions to open sharing
* insights into organisations already implementing RAP
* guidance on the different levels of RAP that can be achieved and how

Importantly, the playbook is intended to complement existing Government and NHS guidance, including the resources available on this website.

It's worth noting that the [Health RAP Playbook] is currently in its **alpha testing phase**. Future releases are expected to broaden the scope of the playbook to cater to those less familiar with RAP. These upcoming topics include understanding what RAP entails in health, emphasising the significance of RAP in health, and providing specific resources for individuals already involved in RAP within smaller local teams.

The team behind the playbook encourage users to [provide feedback] on the resource in order to improve the site.
