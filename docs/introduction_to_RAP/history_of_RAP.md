# The History of RAP
We thought it was worth laying out some of the key moments in RAP history - thanks to colleagues from NHS England and the Government Data Science Community for filling in the gaps!

## Pre-RAP - The promotion of open code
**2017**
: A number of govt articles from this time promote open code, and what should and should not be published:

     * [Service Manual: Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)
     * [Open Source Guidance: When code should open or closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed)
     * [Open Source Guidance: Security considerations when coding in the open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open)
     * [Central Digital and Data Office: Be open and use Open Source](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/be-open-and-use-open-source)

: Ed Humpherson, DG at [OSR](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) wrote a [blog](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/blog/a-robot-by-any-name/) about the first MoJ RAP, which took inspiration from [the eesectors RAP exemplar](https://github.com/DCMSstats/eesectors).


## Early history of RAP
**2018**
: Matt Upson wrote the original post (he has since regretted calling it 'RAP') and helped develop 'the first RAP'. The Government Digital Service (GDS) Data Science team owned and developed it (@matthewgregory_gds, @duncangarmonsway_gds et al.) before it moved across to the ONS/Analytical Function. Matt Gregory put together the original RAP companion and even a "Massive Open Online Course" (MOOC).

     * [RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)
     * [Introduction to RAP course by the Govt Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap/)
     * [ONS Data Science Campus - RAP journey training course](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/capability/data-science-campus-faculty/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-journey/)

: Chris Fairbanks at MoJ wins second prize in the 2018 International Young Statisticians competition, from the [International Association of Official Statistics](https://iaos-isi.org/) for his paper ‘Reproducible Analytical Pipelines in Offender Management Statistics'


**2020**
: Flourishing of blog posts in 2020s, e.g. [Rappers Delight](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/24/rappers-delight/)

**2021**
: RAP Squad (the team running this site!) founded in 2021 within NHS Digital - [Connor Quinn](https://github.com/ConnorQuinn) and [Helen Richardson](https://github.com/helrich)

## RAP goes mainstream:
**2022**
: Starting to formalise and bring together under central government ([Govt Analysis function RAP page](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/))

    * [**Goldacre Review** talks extensively about RAP](https://www.goldacrereview.org/)
    * [Data Saves Lives talks about RAP](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data/* data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data)
    * [Cross Govt RAP strategy is launched](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/)
    * A good summary of the above by Jess Morely is [here](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2022/07/bennett-insights-an-overview-of-uk-data-policy-developments)

**2023**
: [ONS publishes their RAP implementation plan, followed by other departments](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/departmental-rap-plans/)
