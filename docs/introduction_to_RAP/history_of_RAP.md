## Pre-RAP - The promotion of open code
**2017**
: A number of govt articles from this time promote open code, and what should and should not be published:

     * [Service Manual: Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)
     * [Open Source Guidance: When code should open or closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed)
     * [Open Source Guidance: Security considerations when coding in the open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open)
     * [Central Digital and Data Office: Be open and use Open Source](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/be-open-and-use-open-source)

: **Matt Upson wrote the [original blog post on RAP](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/)** (he has since regretted calling it 'RAP') and helped develop 'the first RAP'

: Matt Upson and Matt Gregory: [Transforming the process of producing official statistics](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/27/transforming-the-process-of-producing-official-statistics/)

: Ed Humpherson, Director General at [OSR](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) writes a [blog](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/blog/a-robot-by-any-name/) about the first Ministry of Justice RAP, which took inspiration from [the eesectors RAP exemplar](https://github.com/DCMSstats/eesectors).


## Early history of RAP
**2018**
: The Government Digital Service (GDS) Data Science team continued to develop RAP (@matthewgregory_gds, @duncangarmonsway_gds et al.) prior to it moving across to the ONS/Analytical Function. Matt Gregory put together the original RAP companion and even a "Massive Open Online Course" (MOOC).
