# RAP Community of Practice

## Aims

This community of practice aims to support teams in adopting RAP practices through:

1. **Developing learning materials including reusable templates**
2. **Offering support as teams establish new working practices**

See more about our [aims][7].

## Support

If your team is embarking upon a RAP journey, you should look at our [what is RAP][1] page and think about which [levels of RAP][2] that you want to target.

There are several forums where you can introduce yourself, ask for help, or discuss different approaches:

- NHS Digital RAP [MS Teams page][rap community of practice teams page] (internal to NHS Digital).
- [RAP Slack channel](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/archives/C03N1GXHEH0) from the [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) community.
- [RAP collaboration Slack channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/archives/C6H22U3H9) on the cross-government data science Slack Workspace (open to all civil servants, including NHS staff).

See more about how we can [support][9] you and your team.

## Tutorials and resources

As we work alongside teams at NHS Digital, we try to produce reusable learning materials. We try to avoid reproducing guidance that is easily available online. Instead, we link to lots of external resources where you can self-serve.

We also have created some bespoke guidance that lays out how you would accomplish these practices in the NHS Digital setting, which are available internally.

The Implementing RAP folder has its own README to explain the content on:

- [General Guidance][11]
- [Git resources][10]
- [Python resources][4]
- [PySpark resources][12]
- [R resources][8]

These resources are demand-driven so if you think of something worth including, improving, or want to contribute, please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice/issues) or contact the team via the [MS Teams page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aEnoJ_c3NIwcWaLoqHyrbmiui8SI-8lZ1B2SvxNuGbyU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1c1528d7-030e-48eb-92cf-dc0f6a618ea0&tenantId=50f6071f-bbfe-401a-8803-673748e629e2) (internal to NHS Digital), or [email](mailto:datascience@nhs.net).

## Misc

We have taken inspiration from the [NHS Digital software engineering COP](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/master/insights/review.md). It has tons of great material so I encourage you to read and reflect on these working practices.
