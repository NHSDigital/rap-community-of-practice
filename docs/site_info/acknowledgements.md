It's taken a lot of work to make the NHS England RAP Community of Practice and further the cause of RAP within NHS England more generally.

Many people have pitched in, doing what they could, often **going the extra mile** and ultimately with the **goal of helping our fellow analysts**.
The **NHS England Data Science Skilled Team** has been the core of this work, but in particular the **Data Science RAP Squad** lead the charge, piece by piece moving mountains and making a lasting difference.

**Many thanks and congratulations** to the following for their incredible hard work.
