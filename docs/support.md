# Support

If your team is embarking upon a RAP journey, you should look at our [benefits and aims of RAP][1] and think about which [levels of RAP][2] that you want to target.

From there, we recommend reaching out for some in-person support.

## Support for NHS Digital colleagues

**If you work at NHS Digital**, the **Data Science RAP squad are your main RAP Champions: get in touch!** We you can offer some in-person support in several forms:

- Reviewing your RAP work and assessing your progress against the [levels of RAP][2]
- Peer review of code
- Workshops for a specific RAP capability
- Consultancy style engagement where we plan a migration strategy
- Pair coding
- Shadowing another team

There is also a growing community of RAP experts outside the Data Science RAP squad - you can find them on our NHS Digital RAP MS Teams page (internal to NHS Digital).
