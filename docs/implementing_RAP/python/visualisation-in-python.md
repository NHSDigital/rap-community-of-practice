# Visualisations in Python

## Intro to python visualisations

Creating visualisations in this day and age can be confusing, most of us wish to convey information and data using several fancy data visualisation tools but in reality, to reach the end result of that flashy animated time series chart, a lot of effort is required if you're starting with a blank code script.

People and data visualisation experts are happy to share their code and knowledge behind the graphs or interactive maps they produced. Consequently, we don't have to open the pie chart python documentation and magically understand how to edit some of the chart's features, we can just re-use existing visualisations, learn and understand the process and code behind the end result and use the parts that are applicable for our plots. In the spirit of this, feel free to practice with and use the plots demonstrated in this guide. See Matplotlib Examples Gallery:

- [Matplotlib Examples gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html)

There are many python packages that provide different features in order to create all kinds of plots. We will present one of the most commonly used packages in this guide: Matplotlib.

## Basic plots

Using Matplotlib you can plot all kinds of charts such as histograms, barplots, scatterplots, pie charts etc. For example, if we import the matplotlib module:

```
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.plot(df['My value 1'], df['My value 2']) # this will produce a basic line chart for two selected columns from dataframe df
plt.show() # this command is required to display the plot
```

Using the famous iris dataset we can produce a scatter plot of the sepal length and the sepal width: We load the Seaborn package to import the iris dataset:

```
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# View a list of pre-loaded Seaborn datasets
for dataset in sns.get_dataset_names():
    print(dataset)

df = sns.load_dataset("iris") # we import iris data
print(df.head(3)) # view first 3 rows of the data

# Create a scatter plot
plt.scatter(df['sepal_length'], df['sepal_width'], color='green', marker='s')
plt.xlabel('Sepal length') # x axis title/label
plt.ylabel('Sepal width') # y axis title/label
plt.show()
```

Notice how we set the colour of the data points (color parameter) and the shape (marker parameter = square). To edit the transparency degree (alpha parameter) of the points:

```
# Edit data points transparency with the parameter alpha
plt.scatter(df['sepal_length'], df['sepal_width'], alpha=0.2)
plt.xlabel('Sepal length')
plt.ylabel('Sepal width')
plt.show()
```

## Applications

Using the [Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use among Young People in England 2018 [NS]](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/smoking-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england/2018/part-1-smoking-prevalence-and-consumption) plots displayed on the webpage, we attempt to recreate them using Matplotlib. To create the first plot (line chart):

### Plot 1 - Pupils who have ever smoked, by year [Line chart]

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

path_1 = "python\data\csv_v1.csv" # load the dummy data csv we created
df1 = pd.read_csv(path_1) # Create a Pandas dataframe
```

After loading our Python packages and dummy data we can start working on producing the first plot:

```
# Create a line chart (Plot 1)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) # set the figure size
plt.plot(df1['Year'], df1['Percent'], label="Sepal", linewidth=2, linestyle='-') # create the plot

# Define labels and ticks
plt.ylabel("Percent", loc='top', rotation="horizontal") # y label title and location
plt.xticks(np.arange(1982, 2020, step=2)) # x axis ticks range
plt.yticks(np.arange(0, 70, step=10)) # y axis ticks range
plt.grid(axis='y') # opting for y axis gridlines

# Create annotations (done here for one annotation to avoid redundancy)
plt.annotate('Jan 2003: Large new health warnings on cigarette packs', xy=(2003, 42), xytext=(2003, 52), size=9,
                                                                        bbox=dict(boxstyle="square", fc='0.95', pad=1, ec="none"),
                                                                        arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05, width=0.5, headwidth=6))
plt.box(False) # remove outer borders
plt.savefig('SDD_YP_England_2018_plot1.pdf', bbox_inches='tight') # save plot as .pdf file
plt.savefig('SDD_YP_England_2018_plot1.png', bbox_inches='tight') # save as .png
plt.savefig('SDD_YP_England_2018_plot1.svg', bbox_inches='tight') # save as .svg
```

Notice how `plt.show()` which displays the plot is not included in this code as it's not necessary as we are saving our plots with the `plt.savefig()` function. The three plots will be saved in the local folder your code is also stored or in a folder of your choice. Presenting the .svg image:

![](../../images/plot4.svg)

The advantages of a .svg file compared to using a .png file is better outlined through reading [Benefits of using SVG (scalable vector graphics)](https://blog.tbhcreative.com/2017/06/benefits-of-using-svg.html#:~:text=Scalability,size%20they%20are%20being%20at.&text=The%20SVG%20image%20is%20clear,version%20starts%20to%20appear%20pixelated.).

### Plot 3 - Pupils who have ever smoked, by age [Horizontal bar chart]

Similarly, to create the third plot (horizontal bar chart) on the publication webpage:

```
# Create the Pandas dataframe
percent_y = [2, 7, 14, 22, 31]
index = ['11 years', '12 years', '13 years', '14 years', '15 years']
df = pd.DataFrame({'Percent': percent_y}, index = index)

# Plot the horizontal bar chart
ax = df.plot.barh() # plot the chart
ax.invert_yaxis() # invert the y axis
plt.xlabel("Percent", loc='right', rotation="horizontal") # place the x label
ax.get_legend().remove() # remove the unnecessary legend
ax.set_axisbelow(True)
ax.grid(color='gray', which='major', axis='x', linestyle='-', alpha=0.2) # last 2 commands create and style the x axis gridlines
plt.box(False) # remove plot borders
plt.show()
```

In this case we opted to display the chart, if you wish to save it then `plt.savefig()` function should be added at the end of the code.
