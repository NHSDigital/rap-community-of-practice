## How to implement RAP

!!! tip "TLDR"
    - Start by doing a skills assessment and identifying training needs
    - Then map out the process you want to create or replace
    - Decide on a "thin slice" - a single figure from a single output that you aim to produce first
    - Create an effective workflow with good coding practices, tests, and version control
    - Get to work and start coding up the thin slice
    - Expand the thin slice to complete the pipeline

??? question "Why should we care?"
    - A little planning can go a long way!
    - Unless your team already has a high level of coding skill, the RAP process is going to be largely about upskilling and learning good working practices
    - This process is conducive to creating good working practices, identifying problem points early, and building solid documentation
