!!! tip "TLDR"
    - Start by doing a skills assessment and identifying training needs
    - Then map out the process you want to create or replace
    - Decide on a "thin slice" - a single figure from a single output that you aim to produce first
    - Create an effective workflow with good coding practices, tests, and version control
    - Get to work and start coding up the thin slice
    - Expand the thin slice to complete the pipeline

??? question "Why should we care?"
    - A little planning can go a long way!
    - Unless your team already has a high level of coding skill, the RAP process is going to be largely about upskilling and learning good working practices
    - This process is conducive to creating good working practices, identifying problem points early, and building solid documentation

    |Pre-requisite | Importance | Note |

So you want to implement the RAP principles in your own team?

That's great! This section provides guidance to teams who are looking to start working in the RAP way.

This advice is based on the experiences of the NHS England RAP Squad. They have been working with teams to "RAPify" their processes since around 2021. 

Here's the recommended approach:

## Skills Assessment

First of all, conduct a skills assessment to identify training needs, whether that's going to be in technical skills like programming, git, or using a new data platform, or project management skills like working in Agile and using kanban boards.

## Process Mapping

A process map is essentially just a flow chart of the process you want to build. It can really help get your head around the process, identify redundant steps, and serves as great documentation for future team members.

[Process Mapping](process-mapping.md)

## The Thin Slice

It can be very useful to create a "thin slice" at first. This is where you aim to produce just a single figure our statistic from your output first. Once you have something that runs end-to-end, you can expand outwards from there.

[Thin Slice](thin-slice-strategy.md)

## Set up good working practices

When creating analytical processes in code, it's crucial to work in a way that makes the code more readable, more re-usable, and more robust. So make sure your using great working practices like regular code reviews, using functions, writing unit tests, and so on.

The "Workflow" sub-section on the menu has loads of tips for you!

Start here: [Technical Workflow](workflow/technical-workflow/)

## Get to it!

Then you can get to work on your pipeline!

We've created an [example pipeline](example-pipeline.md) that shows a very (very!) simple implementation of these principles so you can see them in action.

## Support

No need to go it alone if you don't want to! There are plenty of places you can get some help. Have a look at the [support](support-models.md) page for some great options.
