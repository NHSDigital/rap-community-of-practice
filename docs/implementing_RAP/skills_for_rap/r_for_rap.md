Before you embark on your RAP journey, we think it's best for you to have some basic skills in the open source language that you are going to build the pipeline in. If that language is R, read on to find out if you have the skills needed already.

Unlike Python, we don't have that much training for using R as we mostly use Python, but [check out the links](/training_resources/R/) we have for some great guidance written by others.

=== "**R Master**" 
    If you've used R before and are confident in your abilities- great! Be aware that some in your team might not have the skills you do and might need some extra help with the basics. Offer to buddy up with some of the R Newbies if they're struggling so everyone can quickly get up to scratch. Check out the Desirable Skills checklist above in case there is something you could brush up on.

=== "**R Apprentice**"
     Have you got some familiarity with R but you're not sure if you know enough for RAP? Try out the essential skills checklist above - you will learn a lot from implementing RAP, but having these basic skills will allow everyone to get off to a flying start. You probably know more than you think!

=== "**R Newbie**"
     Never even heard of R? No worries, there is extensive R training out there to get you off on the right foot. Don't be afraid to reach out to some R Masters in your team if you need help understanding something - there's no such thing as a stupid question! Check out our [links to  R training](/training_resources/R/) and come back and tick off what you know on the checklist so you can tailor your learning to the important stuff!
