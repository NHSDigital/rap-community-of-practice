Line about how programmers often reuse code and how you probably do too.

But did you know that not all code can be used - or at least, there are some restrictions on what, where, and how you use it?

That's where **software licences** come in.

A software licence is a little bit of legal text you add to your code repository, that tells people what they can and can't do with the code.

Licences range from super free "You can do anything at all with this code", to super strict "You can read this code, but that's it. Don't you even think about using it."

And there are a LOT of different licenses, each with their own nuances.
