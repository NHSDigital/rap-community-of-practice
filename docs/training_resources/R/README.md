We do not have many materials for R since the majority of our users use Python.

However, there is an excellent set of guidance here on doing RAP in R:

- [Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R](https://raps-with-r.dev/)

From UK Government Data Science, there is the original RAP companion, which is about R:

- [R RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

The [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) has excellent resources including:

- [Introduction to R training](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r)
- [R Markdown Training](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/rmd-workshop)

The NHS England R Community also has some very nice R resources:

- [https://nhsengland.github.io/nhs-r-reporting/](https://nhsengland.github.io/nhs-r-reporting/)
- Including an [excellent guide on using Quarto for reports](https://nhsengland.github.io/nhs-r-reporting/tutorials/quarto.html)
