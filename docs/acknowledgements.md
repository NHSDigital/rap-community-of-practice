# Acknowledgements

It's taken a lot of work to make the NHS Digital RAP Community of Practice and further the cause of RAP within NHS Digital more generally.

Many people have pitched in, doing what they could, often **going the extra mile** and ultimately with the **goal of helping our fellow analysts**.
The **NHS Digital Data Science Skilled Team** has been the core of this work, but in particular the **Data Science RAP Squad** lead the charge, piece by piece moving mountains and making a lasting difference.

**Many thanks and congratulations** to the following for their incredible hard work.
