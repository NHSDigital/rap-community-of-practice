# Our RAP Service

This section focussed on the management, planning, and strategy for embedding RAP practices in a large organisation. We've tried a lot of different things so far - with varying levels of success. My hope is that sharing our approach and considerations will help others.

## ONS RAP Report

The single most valuable tool we have had in our work is the report from the ONS about
[overcoming barriers to RAP adoption](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/). Almost every one of the considerations discussed in this report has been relevant for us in the past year.

I would strongly encourage organisations who want to adopt RAP practices to read this report and share with senior leaders. You might also consider running a [pre-mortem](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem) with the project sponsor and senior analytical leaders to anticipate and avoid some of the problems mentioned in this report.

## NHS Digital rollout strategy

**Support models**. The most important principle for supporting RAP adoption in NHS Digital has been to adapt our offering to the needs of teams. As we have worked with different teams it has been clear that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach. Instead we negotiate the support model with teams based on a variety of considerations. [Learn about the different support models and considerations in the Support Models section][1].

**How to train your team**. Selecting your team for a RAP project and with the aim of upskilling your team can be challenging to strike the right balance. We make several recommendations on timescales, how to select your RAP team and training pathways depending on the analyst team's capability. [Learn how to build team capability][8]

**Service design**. We have taken this approach a step further by framing the work of the central RAP team as a service. We have gone through a number of rounds of service design and user research. [Learn more about our approach to RAP service design][2]

**Typical engagement**. One very effective way to encourage teams to engage with RAP is to give them sight of what a typical project might look like. This narrative account gives a high-level view of the activities at each phase of the engagement. [Learn about a typical engagement with the RAP team][3]

**Thin-slice strategy**. When migrating an existing publication to a RAP pipeline, we often adopt a 'thin-slice' strategy. [Learn more about the thin-slice strategy for migrations][4]

**Programme-level reporting**. While most of our work focussed on teams and pipelines, it is important to track roll-out at a high level. This section discussed how we track progress. [Learn more about our programme level reporting][5]

## Support

If your team is embarking upon a RAP journey, you should look at our [what is RAP][6] page and think about which [levels of RAP][7] that you want to target.

From there, we recommend reaching out for some in-person support.

**If you work at NHS Digital**, the **Data Science RAP squad are your main RAP Champions: get in touch!** We you can offer some in-person support in several forms:

- Reviewing your RAP work and assessing your progress against the [levels of RAP][7]
- Peer review of code
- Workshops for a specific RAP capability
- Consultancy style engagement where we plan a migration strategy
- Pair coding
- Shadowing another team

There is also a growing community of RAP experts outside the Data Science RAP squad - you can find them on our [RAP Community of Practice Teams Page] (NHS Digital only)

**If you're not in NHS Digital**, the [RAP Champions Network](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/reproducible-analytical-pipeline-rap-champions) can offer support through:

- helping you understand why and how they implemented RAP in your department and why it worked for them
- sharing code via platforms like GitHub so that others can learn from and adapt what has been done
- shadowing & mentoring opportunities
- peer review

They also have more guidance on how to get started, and get help [here](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2022/08/08/mentoring-a-successful-rap-project/).

There are several forums where you can introduce yourself, ask for help, or discuss different approaches:

- NHS Digital RAP [MS Teams page][rap community of practice teams page] (internal to NHS Digital).
- [RAP Slack channel](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/archives/C03N1GXHEH0) from the [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) community.
- [RAP collaboration Slack channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/archives/C6H22U3H9) on the cross-government data science Slack Workspace (open to all civil servants, including NHS staff).
