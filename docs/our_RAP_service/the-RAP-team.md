# Structure of the team

Following the recommendations in the [Overcoming Barriers to RAP](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/)
 report, we have set up a central RAP team to coordinate efforts and set standards across NHS Digital. 
 
 This team tends to be made up of about 5 data scientists and we flex the resource up and down according to demand.

Over time, we hope that the central RAP team can be resourced with a mix of all kinds of roles in NHS Digital. We think that this collaborative approach to resourcing will make it more likely that the whole community owns the problem. 

There are already lots of people playing an informal 'RAP champion' role by supporting colleagues. This group of people would be the natural candidates to guide the NHS Digital RAP community over time.
