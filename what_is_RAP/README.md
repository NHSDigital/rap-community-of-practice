# What is RAP and why should I care?

Scientific research has increasingly relied on code to conduct complex statisticial analyses in recent years. As code has become ubiquitous, new ways of working have emerged to ensure that scientific findings are rigorous and reproducible.

These practices have been applied to government analytic work under the banner of **Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)**. RAPs bring together a number of good practices to help ensure all published statistics meet the highest standards of transparency and reproducibility.

Over time, all analytical work in NHSD (and across government) will be expected to adopt the RAP practices. For example, RAP practices are a key element needed in order to meet the standards of quality analysis set out in the [Aqua Book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government). This adoption will take time and should not be considered as all-or-nothing. There are stages to RAP. Teams can take the journey one step at a time with support from this community.

## Benefits of RAP

The Benefits and Aims of RAP page provides information on our goal to implement RAP within NHS Digital, why RAP is useful and how we want to support teams at NHS Digital (and wider) to implement RAP.

- [The benefits of using RAP and how the community of practice aims to support teams in adopting RAP practices][1]

## Our Levels of RAP

At NHS Digital we have devised three 'levels' of RAP that helps guide teams of different maturity levels.

The levels of RAP offer teams a way to see how to improve on their current practices, incrementally. We encourage teams to start at _baseline RAP_ as an absolute minimum and then progress towards _gold RAP_ which we view as the best practice for teams.

## Useful links

This is a list, we have collated, of RAP resources throughout the Government and other areas. Let us know if you have any links to useful information, resources or guides that could be added to the list.

### Strategic

- The Government Analysis Function has published their [RAP strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/). It's very good for understanding what role we all have to play in RAP.
- The [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis) mentions RAP extensively as a key tool in improving the way we use patient data.
- [Here](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2022/07/bennett-insights-an-overview-of-uk-data-policy-developments/) is a helpful summary of the above documents and others which helps understand RAP and why it is important in the context of UK data policy developments.

### Guidance and Standards

- The [AQUA book of analytical standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government).
- The [ONS best practice team have a useful website - often called the Quack book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) covering many of the same topics we cover here. Their [best-practice checklist](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/checklist_higher.html) is particularly useful.
- The Turing Institute has published [The Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html)

### Examples, Challenges, Benefits

- Here is a good [high-level overview of RAP](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/). It explains the context of RAP in government statistics and gives some history to the work.
- The GSS have produced a list of the [benefits that come from RAP](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/benefits-to-government-from-reproducible-analytical-pipelines/).
- The Statistics Authority has published this excellent report on [overcoming barriers to RAP adoption](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/).
- Alston, J. M., and Rick, J. A.. 2020. A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research. Bull Ecol Soc Am 102(2):e01801. https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1801
- The GSS training portal offers an [Introduction to RAP course](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap/)
- The Government Analysis Function also did some [research on the rollout of RAP across different deparments](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/CARS-3/index.html).

### Community spaces

- There are several slack channels that discuss RAP and related topics: the [govdatascience.slack.com RAP channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/archives/C6H22U3H9), the [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/), and the [NHS-pycom community](https://nhs-pycom.slack.com/)
- We have an [MS Teams page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aEnoJ_c3NIwcWaLoqHyrbmiui8SI-8lZ1B2SvxNuGbyU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1c1528d7-030e-48eb-92cf-dc0f6a618ea0&tenantId=50f6071f-bbfe-401a-8803-673748e629e2) (internal to NHS Digital)
