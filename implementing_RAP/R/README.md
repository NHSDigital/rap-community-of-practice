# R

We do not have many materials for R since the majority of our users use Python.

The [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/) has excellent resources including:

- [Introduction to R training](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r)
- [R Markdown Training](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/rmd-workshop)

From the UK Government Data Science:

- [R RAP Companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)
