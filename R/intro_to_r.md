# Introduction to R and RStudio
The NHS Digital Analytical Services use lots of tools and applications to produce [NHSD reports and publications](https://digital.nhs.uk/data). A large amount of these reports are produced by open-source programming languages, such as Python and R. 

The NHS-R Community have created a great set of R beginner friendly resources from their Workshop materials on teaching "Introduction to R" via RStudio.

The NHS-R guide we link below aims to support existing NHSD R users and/or anyone who's keen on picking up a new open-source programming language.
